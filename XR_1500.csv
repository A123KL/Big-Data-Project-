I don't remember the exact time stamp for when he discusses overpopulation, but it's around minute 10, so you don't need to (but you should) listen long.\n\nThe short of it is that overpopulation has always been brought up not as a serious academic pursuit, but as an ideological statement about economic conditions. Swedish elites declared the country overpopulated because creating enough jobs for all Swedes would cut into the profit margins of businesses. Malthus declared the world overpopulated not because he had any kind of serious ecological understanding of carrying capacity, but because the conditions of the English working class were so appalling. Conditions that were not determined by ecological factors but social ones. Further, he blamed them for those conditions they did not create. Ehrlich was an entomologist who got big on a millenarian grift by refusing to examine actual ecology and focusing on the lifecycle of insects as if it were representative of human ecology. It was a proposition that was attractive for two reasons, both of them ugly and unscientific. The first was its sensational proclamations of doom brought on by the unwashed masses of Africa and Asia dooming white civilisation. Second because it appeals to a vicious, evil mindset that views humans as cancers, pests, vermin, etc. to be exterminated for the 'good of the planet.'\n\nModern reinterpretations of these millenarians and fascists are no more rigorous, and blatantly ignore realities of how consumption happens, how population curves work, and basic scientific rigour.

Moreover, they need a huge infrastructure net to supply them, making long supply lines necessary. To feed a city you need land as well. Land that has to have a relatively high nutritional output to human Labour ratio (i.e. industrial agriculture). Yes, you can mitigate a lot of effects by universally implementing regenerative agriculture, and that land would have a net positive impact on earth system stability, but the earth is a self regulating system and needs sufficient agency, I.e. undisturbed nature. I do want to add that I think if we move away from industry and organize life in a communal manner, the problem of unbridled population growth will solve itself. Though that would not allow for megacities.', 'You assume that it doesn’t, I assume that it does. Those assumptions are of the same nature. There are about 63824448 square kilometers of useable land on earth, which gives every human, assuming a population of roughly 8 billion, a space of about 8000m^2. I’m not sure about the exact land use of hunter-gatherers, but they most definitely had a bigger land use per person, not to mention the amount of unused land that was necessary for prey populations to be stable. We need undisturbed nature today as much as 100000 years ago.', 'As you appear to know the Truth™️, l am curious to know at what point would you consider the world population number crossing into ‘overpopulation’ - given our current rate of resource consumption? Or is there no such thing?', ""So focus on everything...including limiting population growth via education of women, widspread availability of birth control and abortions, encouraging people of the benefits and joys that come with not having kids while discouraging people from having kids. Enough people will have kids, we don't need to encourage it. \n\nCapitalism is just part of the problem. While i agree it is a major part, it's an obsession and magical thinking to only focus on it while not doing all the other necessary things to create a sustainable world....including population control and degrowth of our population. Our global food system can only feed this much people with environmentally destructive factory farming and animal agriculture, organic faming takes more land and permaculture is not globally scalable with our current population.  It needs to end but can only do so if we reduce our population. We to not only stop our current environmental issues but also restore the biosphere.  Not possible with this many people. \n\nThe planet will soon force this on us with the ramifications of ecocide and biosphere collapse.  \n\nIt's all moot to me, in all honesty. I think we are far past the point of no return. There are too many environmental issues (polycrisis symptoms of overshoot) and too many denialists in all political parties. \n\nCheck out Nate Hagen's on YouTube @thegreatsimplification. He holds out more hope than i, but he is not a denialist that thinks ending capitalism or solving climate change will magically fix our world. It's sad seeing so many denialists in the environmental moement in general. Too many environmentalists are drunk on hopium and need to come back to reality. The hope often intoxicates and prevents critical thinking in favor of must be's and have too's and only if's. After 20+ years in the environmental movement (im 41 and worked for the US Forest Service and US Bureau of Land Management) i see no major environmental victories on a global scale. Things have just gotten progressively worse. All the victories in my time, and the old timers who trained me in environmental sciences and natural resources, have amounted to things just getting worse later on elsewhere. \n\nA reality check is necessary.  \n\nI wish you the best and believe you can learn more if you stop being stuck on the idea that capitalism is the only real issue at play. Be well."", 'I responded to this in long form here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/17zyq3b/overpopulation_its_time_we_dispensed_with_this/ka6moub/', '1.5-2 billion at modern living standards ...\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/26/world-population-resources-paul-ehrlich', ""Well, we can listen to the science, again something we should find uncontroversial. And the science is a big question mark. No one knows what Earth's carrying capacity is. More importantly, changes to our level of consumption dramatically change the carrying capacity even if we could determine it precisely. We shouldn't lie, or make things up, and that's what the overpopulation death cult is. Telling the truth here is not a magical number, but avoiding the impulse to invent magical numbers without adequate evidence.\n\nWe can also look at the science again, I linked the Oxfam report, to see that overpopulation is not the problem. Overwhelmingly, ecological destruction is caused by less than 1% of the population of Earth, and the top 10% causes almost all of it. Whether the remaining 99% is twice as large or half as large, what is unsustainable are the wealthy few. Population doesn't have a causal link to ecological destruction. We could do the Thanos snap, and nothing would change because it is our economic mode, not our population, that is causing resource scarcity and ecological devastation.\n\nI also mentioned Ehrlich's obsession with bugs, and one of the things that overpopulation mythology relies on is the population curve. In entomology, a common reproductive strategy for insects is a boom and bust population dynamic. Breed extremely rapidly until all resources are consumed then die-off. Long generation time, low brood size mammals do not follow that same curve. Instead what we see is exponential growth that levels off as resources become less available. We would expect a small population decline when we reach peak population, but nothing dramatic, until we reach a steady equilibrium (equilibrium not being static, but fluctuating around a mean). Interestingly, we are already seeing this in the human population. Whereas in the 1960s we were in the midst of exponential growth, we are now seeing that taper off. In some places, it is tapering off so dramatically that we are below replacement rate already and you have an equal, opposite demographic panic happening about white replacement and demographic collapse. Overpopulation relies on a myth that human population will expand exponentially until catastrophic collapse. We don't see that in animals with similar reproductive strategies, and we don't see that in the actual demographic data we have available.\n\nThat also tracks with anthropological observations about human population. The major reasons for human population growth are economic. In societies with poor social safety nets and high infant mortality, large families are a coherent economic-reproductive strategy. You need children to take care of you in old age, and you need plenty of spares. As we get richer, and our infant mortality rates decline, that is no longer a coherent economic-reproductive strategy. Interestingly, we see this even in rats! During the Rat Utopia experiments (basically trying to design the perfect rat habitat and observe the consequences), many rats choose to be non-breeders. Humans, it turns out, are much the same and have gracefully invented the means to be non-breeders even if we still enjoy sex."", "">Check out Nate Hagen's on YouTube @thegreatsimplification.\n\nAgreed on the endorsement of **Nate Hagens** \\-\n\n[His Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thegreatsimplification).\n\nHis series of short videos on [The Great Simplification](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/).\n\nI would also highly recommend the ecologist **William Rees.** He's great at [explaining Overshoot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hi9xYSCwZ8&ab_channel=FacingFuture) (28 min video)"", ""Totally agree, it really is down to this - polycrises.\n\nOur planet doesn't care about our silly human tribulations, bickering amongst politicians, climate deniers or believers, Earth just wants balance and equilibrium, and we've well overshot on that.\n\nI don't see any small step towards helping Earth get that balance back.

The Natural World is understood to be feminine and so for Matriarchial societies it would not, indeed, *could not*, be otherised and treated with such disdain, nay contempt, as it is under Patriarchy.

I have no idea what ""No Climate Justice on Occupied Land"" means.  It's just so convoluted and word-salady that I have no idea what people are attempting to communicate with this sentence.

Somebody enlighten me ?",1700106175.0,35,0,,"[""I can't find the stat, but I've seen a few times, that half of all land protection is done by indigenous people even though they only make up 6% of the total earth population. This makes sense if you think about it because Indigenous people are more likely to understand the changes as a result of climate change because they are more likely to live off the land. People are more likely to protect the places that they are familiar with. Notice how nice Switzerland is while Swiss bankers don't have a problem finding factories and mines in other places. There is a reason America would rather bomb Yemen into submission than open more oil wells on their own land.\n\nOn the other side of the issue is non-indigenous capitalism and imperialism that has displaced people in favor of agriculture and industry, two of the main drivers in climate-altering pollution as well as habitat loss.\n\nTherefore it follows that mending the effects of colonialism by returning land to the people who have the least to benefit from its destruction and the most to benefit from a healthy ecosystem go hand in hand. \n\nIn this vein, I really recommend the book Braiding Sweetgrass, about how North American indigenous wisdom can be used to strengthen our understanding of the land we live on. You really can't understand the whole story of America's ecological history without understanding how Native Americans were displaced and why."", 'I think it\'s another wording of ""no climate justice on stolen land"" used especially in the Americas and other colonialised countries. It\'s a recognition that The land has been historically taken by European settlers from native peoples, exploited for reasoces, mined for fossil fuels, intensive agricultural practices, deforestation, and consumerism that we know is driving the climate crisis. Like what happened  in America for the native americans. It\'s a recognition that colonialism as a mass industrialised exploitation of other subjugated peoples\' lands (and bodies) was the match that ignited humanitie\'s climate upheaval. People who had lived for thousands of years in a place and developed a way of life that was more or less in balance with nature and the carbon cycle and reling on it for all their needs, were expelled/denied their husbandry of it over foreign settler\'s who damaged its local nature and through its continued exploitation are damaging the planet as a whole. You wouldn\'t of had the industrial revolution in Britain if you did not have mass amounts of cotton and sugar to process from stolen lands. Further more this process is continuing as indigenous communities are more vulnerable now to climate change, are more likely to have pipelines built through their land, more exposed to industrial, mining and agricultural emissions, their activists more likely to encounter violence, their forests still being logged, and worksites for fossil fuel companies (like pipelines and oil wells) in remote areas within indigenous land are manned by predominantly male staff serving long term contracts, endangering indigenous women and girls living near them. \n\nOther more knowledgeble people on the subject please fill in.', ""I am not as clever or articulate as u/AnthraxCat (thanks for your words) but I recently explained to a fellow protestor that I am as equally concerned for clean air and safe movement for the children in my town as I am for the welfare of children in countries far away.\n\nI have a duty of care to all children and deep concern for their living conditions and their future.\n\nI simplify the concept down to Climate Justice = Social Justice and protest with that in mind. We don't get one without the other."", 'What\'s confusing you?\n\nClimate justice is a coherent political philosophy effectively summed up as ""there is no sustainable world build on exploitation."" Effectively, that we can\'t pretend a green revolution can happen on the back of human emiseration. What we inflict on other people we will inflict on the planet and vice versa. For example, while in theory we could have a renewable energy grid on the backs of slave labour in Africa, ultimately we have just displaced the crisis. Either the exploitation will destroy the ecosystem that we depend on to create the illusion of a sustainable future, or the forces that permit exploitation on the imperial periphery will find their way home. The economic logic that treats you, or someone else, as disposable will also treat an ecosystem as disposable. It asserts as a result, that the climate crisis cannot be truly resolved without addressing issues of human justice. \n\nOccupied land is taken from decolonial struggles. Most notably in this moment, Israel\'s occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and Jerusalem. More radically, Israel itself is built on stolen land even in the 1947 borders due to the colonial project of the [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration). More generally, it refers to the new world nations like the US and Canada, who are built on stolen land, broken treaties, and the faulty [doctrine of discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_doctrine) and[ terra nullius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nullius) and is a call to, at the minimum, respect the treaties that were signed with Indigenous nations.', ""The problem is in the phrase 'climate justice'. It is a meaningless jumble phrase that has only divided communities by dismissing those who spent years and decades fighting against oil companies with whatever means they could, including civil disobedience, as well as any living thing that doesn't fall into some theoretical sociological zone. For the climate affects every living thing on the planet. As a non-human actor, perhaps even a global homeostatic mechanism, there is no concept to 'justice' to be realized in climate. The climate in formerly habitable zones will become drought, devastation, and hunger for all, not just the 'colonizers' or the 'oppressed'. And even as language usage and derivation of meaning changes over time, 'climate justice' activists, or employees, seem to have a willing blindness to that biosystemic fact. As a promotion code for parvenu climate change activists, perhaps it does seem to have some relevance, maybe even a value, although a pointless one. But money is still money, for the time being, so put it onto your next resume and see what happens.\n\n'Occupied lands' is another strange construction, also designed to divide peoples in a time when oil companies and oil states are making plans to fight over diminished resources...to all of our increased danger."", 'Britain still occupies Northern Ireland, and no environmental groups are speaking out.', ""I mean there's no climate justice on occupied land, what is word salady about that?"", ""Poor strategy to try and campaign on more than one issue.\n\nIf you want to campaign on climate change, then go ahead (ignoring the fact that it has been debunked).

I strongly recommend [Noam Chomsky\'s 1969 interview with William Buckley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k9aTeoDBxw) on how to think about these events. There is no use in denying the atrocity of Oct 7, but it\'s important to keep it in context of the much larger, graver crimes being committed in the theatre. I don\'t see a particular reason to condemn Hamas not because they didn\'t do bad things, but because the bad things done in the name of retaliation for them are so, so much worse.', ""How is colonialism is history when israel literally exist, capitalism should be damaged cuz you're not going to have climate friendly future without it.

The only video I've seen alleging rape happened was of a woman being shoved into a car, and a woman lying prone in the bed of a truck that people assumed meant they must have been raped (because men of colour are rapist savages after all). Meanwhile, every hostage who has returned has spoken of their treatment as kind and humane. Survivors in the kibbutzim have described the surreal experience of having fighters and looters raid their fridges, watch Netflix on their TVs, and steal their shoes, but rape is only mentioned as something they feared. There's been no evidence that rape was systemic even if isolated cases occurred, and no evidence that rape was tactical or ordered by Hamas.\n\nMeanwhile, of course, Israel was only recently confronting whistleblowers who revealed [the extensive and constant use of sexual violence in Israeli prisons](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-08-03/ty-article/.highlight/systemic-failure-the-prison-sexual-abuse-scandal-shaking-israel/00000182-63dc-d454-a5aa-e7ddab2b0000)."", ""You really are brainwashed aincha?\n\nFootage can be forund all over the place.

It is full, and I mean full, of bloody, near dismembered dead bodies. After it was emptied, later that day, a journalist was shown the inside, and he actually chokes from the stench of death.

I know you will never see this of course because you are a coward like your heroes.\n\nAlso theres security camera footage which came out later: one that struck me was where they shoot a pedestrian in the back of the head as he walks down the street. Just completely cold blooded murder. And another clip  where they drag two dead bodies out of a car they have shot up and steadily loot them and their vehicle. And another, dashcam footage of a shooting of civilians in their car. There's another one where they fire an RPG at a civilian car.

We are witnessing an event worse than the holocaust. It is a larger evil than we\'ve ever seen before (since the times of Noah\'s flood (which is scientifically proven to have happened)).\n\nWhat neither of these people realize, though, is that elite kabal/illuminati/freemasonry/reptiles/vatican (whatever you want to call them) are essentially under the influence of fallen angels.

There are countless groups with a pure, homogenous world view that are too small and sanctimonious to ever have an influence on the world. Our big movements can not afford to be like this.\n\nGreta only champions one divisive topic like that.

It\'s utterly self defeating. I\'m very bitter about this, because my local XR chapter in a German town also clashed and stagnated over identity politics issues that have no bearing on real world climate action.

While I hope that all members of our chapter recognize that Israel is committing genocide and the US is acting as a soft facilitator of that, we as a climate organization are simply not who anyone is looking toward for guidance on this issue.

Eventually your cowardly big tent falls apart because it can't decide to do anything since it is so obsessed with maintaining its serene neutrality.\n\nSolidarity allows us a rare opportunity to build our movements.

Intersectional rhetoric has attracted a few fully on-board academic leftists to our local group, at the cost of alienating several dozen very focused and effective climate activists that I know of.

The only theory of change XR has crucially depends on mobilizing huge numbers of people, and intersectionality makes us shrink. Partly, that is due to this form of solidarity being a one way street for climate movements. No matter how many radical feminist, BiPOC, trans or Palestinian causes and speakers we platform, somehow we never get invited to their rallies to mobilize for climate struggle within their audience. If they let us, chances are many of their followers would be annoyed that this is not what they turned up for, what they came to put their body and voice behind that day. In that sense, it's not even a proper relationship of solidarity I would say, it's a unilateral transfer of mobilization from the climate movement to others.\n\nAnd make no mistake, I spend a lot of time right now as an individual making people aware of the horrendous crimes of Israel, and I've joined the local cease fire and peace demonstrations.

If so, then *WTF is your point?!?*"", ""> It is challenging, awkward, and sometimes will fail, but it represents the only way to actually grow.\n\nIf we are looking at successful political movements in the past, it is important to recognise that bridging gaps and divides is core to the actual process of building mass movement. No one just focused on a single issue at the exclusion of others. International solidarity was a core component. In a particularly tragic irony, one of XR's prime examples of its theory of change is anti-apartheid movements in South Africa, which very vocally and tangibly supported Palestinian liberation. The civil rights movement in the US famously took up far more than simply voting rights or desegregation (it also took up international causes like, you guessed it, support for Palestinian liberation). You cannot bridge differences by ignoring them, and you see that in your own experience. The fragility of your coalition, such that disagreements cannot be navigated and must inevitably lead to fractures and destruction, demonstrates that you do not have a vigorous, healthy movement. This is why, despite it being glib, I point to this as a skill issue. We are not building successful, coherent movements if our movement can be shattered by a single disagreement. The inability to handle disagreement and difference in a way that is constructive and builds solidarity is a critical weakness which means that we are extremely vulnerable. Not only to state sponsored repression, but even just to being able to welcome new people into our groups. The inability to integrate existing voices, let alone new voices, means we start to treat new members as suspicious, resulting in sclerotic, inward looking organisations.\n\nSolidarity is not transactional. You need to make opportunities and connections, not expect quid-pro-quo transactions of speaking time at rallies. It has enough benefits to us already, simply from practicing it. Solidarity deepens our own understanding of the issues, broadens our tactical and strategic imagination, and critically provides us opportunities to practice the skills of navigating conflict such that we are able to make those relationships happen.\n\nA beautiful example happened yesterday. Some new organisers in my city are planning actions around Palestine solidarity. They have never invited us, and I would never want, to be platformed at one of their rallies, but through the XR chapter we have here we are well recognised as an experienced, principled, and dedicated NVDA team. So people come and talk to us, we lend our support, expertise, and materials, enhancing their movements and building skills in our city. We wouldn't have that recognition and relationship if we had stayed mum on Palestine. Has that stance alienated some of our supporters? Probably, not enough for us to notice, because we have been educating, strengthening, and building relationships with our support base. Will it mean we get speaking roles at rallies? No. Does it mean we get new recruits? No. Does it advance the cause to have more effective NVDA happening in our city, a greater acceptance and understanding of its necessity, and bonds of commonality that reinforce any action we will take with supporters, donations, and understanding? Absolutely. Does it offer us opportunities to confront issues in the community from a place of trust and respect? One hundred percent. Could we fuck it up and lose any benefit? Absolutely. Could the people we're working with disappear and ghost us? Absolutely.\n\nIntersectional rhetoric is divisive and largely useless. Intersectional practice is fundamental to building movements that move. I share your distaste for academic leftists, and we are dealing with some growing pains integrating them ourselves. We're not going to stop doing that though, they bring valuable knowledge and skills to us, and have some quirks and their own social skill issues to deal with. We will be tested in our ability to integrate them, we are also not perfect. But that's the work."", 'I don\'t agree with you on preserving civilization - I think it was a wrong turn for humanity and this mode of living has entirely disconnected us from Nature.\n\nBut you\'re absolutely right in the criticism of groups losing focus and taking sides on all sorts of other *human* concerns in politics. Even citing that you have in your own group seen the division it causes falls on deaf ears to the ""cause warrior"" type of Leftist who is all about every ""social struggle"" being looped in.\n\nAnd with the Palestinian issue specifically, there is no indication that they are different from Brits or Indians (or Chinese or Brazilians or Kenyans, or even Israelis) in that the people of all these civilized societies want to keep their electricity going, even if that means pollution from mining and extraction and burning. Environmentalism is fully corrupted by anthropocentric people.', 'I wholeheartedly agree. What we have isn’t really capitalism of Smith’s mind anyway. It’s just corporate feudalism based on consumerism. \n\nYou could still have a market economy if it weren’t structured to funnel everything to the very top of the pyramid', ""The person above you didn't say humans didn't cause climate change, they said that the effects extend beyond humanity and our issues.

The difference between the two is only that to the ecofascists the “white” race is the hero of the story, whereas the ordinary left makes the same race into the villain.\n\nDoes that sound like a racist\'s message?!?\n\nI can only hope y\'all might start to realize that you are not nearly as informed as you think, but rather highly *mis*informed.', 'Alright, quoted:\n“They want to integrate the black man\ninto the system, make him a business executive,\na lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class\nwhite people. The leftists will reply that the\nlast thing they want is to make the black man\ninto a copy of the white man; instead,\nthey want to preserve African American culture.\nBut in what does this preservation of African\nAmerican culture consist? It can hardly consist\nin anything more than eating black-style food,\nlistening to black-style music, wearing\nblack-style clothing and going to a black-style\nchurch or mosque. In other words, it can express\nitself only in superficial matters.”\n\nI would say that the simplefication is racist; although it is ignorant. It is a sum of things white men ‘want’ them to be and also appears to be something that they cannot be according to TK.  it implies that there is no free choice in the matter, which is quite paradoxal in itself.\n\nWith another quote about genetics and IQ, which is not the same context, but reinforces my point.\n“Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of\nhuman abilities or behavior because such explanations\ntend to make some persons appear superior or inferior\nto others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit\nor blame for an individual\'s ability or lack of it. Thus\nif a person is ""inferior"" it is not his fault, but\nsociety\'s, because he has not been brought up properly.""\n\nAnd the last point, the excessive use of the N-word', '""Excessive use of the N-word""...?\n\nYou\'ve totally missed the point of the first quoted paragraph (FYI, Reddit has a way to format quotes). It makes me feel that trying to explain it would be a waste of my time. Simply put, everyone must conform, cultural practices must be within boundaries that do not impede technological progress. Hunting is restricted, parenting is regulated and legislated, groups cannot be allowed to have conflicts but must turn to the courts and police, etc. It\'s not at all racist, but it does serve as a test of aptitude.\n\nAgain, the second paragraph is not at all racist, and I think you\'re just doing what he says, but only in reaction to him saying that\'s what Leftists do. Lol, but sad. Are people different in ability due to genetics and luck-of-the-draw biology? Yes. Leftists hate that and think everyone should be equal throughout life. It\'s not racist, you need to improve your cognitive and reasoning skills. You\'re probably getting upset reading things which challenge your ideals, thus you\'re not even properly reading and processing it.', ""I understand what it says, although English is not my native language, so in grammatical way there might be some errors and be a part of poor translation.   \n\n\nWhat I mean by it, is that when taken distance of certain groups (which is what happenend). Without said closeness to the problems, the problem is that he's trying to rationalize it. While it isn't staight up, it may lead to said racism, even for other interpretations. You can't choose the left because they make poor decisions, but trust me instead! I think he was just punching the air when it came to conformism, nobody is pushing anybody in certain roles on a political level, or culture level, as leftists do described by TK. Say, we have a black leftist, is he then not allowed to be that? Yes. Is he allowed to be right? Yes. People can vote, people do have choices. Do I think TK is right? Only to an extent.  \n\n\nMan, to go back to the conform, they probably wished they had that kind of power, to push people in just one conform is impossible.   \nHell, that conformism is even part of democracy, our freedom. Is it flawed? Fuck yes, but does it work better than any other system? Yes.  \n\n\nIt also makes me wonder what the other side of the political spectrum would like to do? Can we read about that in his manifesto? \n\n  \nAnd my guy, let's not go ad hominem here. I'm not even upset, I am actually just trying to broaden my view and challenge my ideals, but for me, with rational reasoning, you can only get that far.""]"

Protest Visibility App: Emergency SOS,New_Heat_8496,4,17s7z6f,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/17s7z6f/protest_visibility_app_emergency_sos/,0,"Hi everyone!

I’m a recent university graduate from the UK. With a team of friends, we’ve been developing an SOS app for students. It’s called Flare, and it allows you to quickly send emergency messages via text to friends and family. 

We’ve developed the app with activism specifically in mind, and we’ve created features that are designed to support a strong security culture. For example, when your message is sent, all the data associated with it is wiped from our servers within seconds. We don’t collect any data at all on users, and we work under the principle that if any data was requested about a particular user, we simply wouldn’t be able to provide it.

We’re working with lots of student activist groups in the UK. They have supported us at every step of the way.

The app is completely free and has just launched for iOS and Android. We’re trying to get the word out, and if this is a mission that resonates with you, we’d really appreciate your support!

the most important part of activism?,echo-eco-ethos,3,16knmy2,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/16knmy2/the_most_important_part_of_activism/,16,"It seems like we all have the same goal of outreach, along with helping heal /  sustain / live in harmony with this beautiful planet— but —what do you feel the most important part of activism **itself** is?

&#x200B;

• the amount of news coverage?

• how many people noticed?

• how many people who witnessed the demonstration left feeling inspired to change their behaviors / share that feeling with as many other people as possible?

&#x200B;

Let's start a dialogue about this - I’ve seen a lot of cruel things being said lately, and this topic seems really important.

&#x200B;

Coming from a background of vegan activism led to this realization: **Most people will not change their perspective after an interaction with an activist offended them / shamed them**

Maybe you’re thinking that some people *should* be offended, since their choices are impacting the  environment / other people in a negative way -

but **if the goal = more people making sustainable choices**, would it make more sense to **approach these topics in a way that** ***doesn’t*** **create animosity towards the movement as a whole?**

&#x200B;

If you’re already on board with this way of thinking - what has helped your conversations the most?( what have you found to be the most impactful way of helping people understand the scope & solutions to our environmental problems? )

&#x200B;

I could keep going - but **does anyone else think this is an important collective conversation that really could impact the trajectory of our future?**

&#x200B;

( **even if a protest is aimed at a corporation / not at individuals** \- aren’t we the ones supporting them with our purchases?Looking at how many vegan options exist now, compared to a few years ago - these companies may adapt to demands of the general public, especially if the change is simple.obviously much different for gas/oil - but if gas were to be less available, or if there was a drastic raise in price - wouldn’t there be a pushback/protest from the general public? Many people need to be able to travel in order to work, feed their family, etc. So until another option for travel is discovered - in a way we may need these companies to continue? Obviously that’s not ideal - but it feels like these are the types of crucial conversations we should a ll be having, and helping as many Mina work towards finding a solution as possible? )

&#x200B;

Still, I’m finding myself feeling gaslit by the lack of good faith discourse about the jeopardy that we/biodiversity/the planet are facing. 
For me, it’s not just the obvious culprits (big corporations, big Ag, etc) it’s friends, office colleagues, respectable institutions, etc. Knowing the emissions cuts that must be made over the next 6 years, it seems that business and lifestyle  conversations should reflect that transition. Even in highly educated spaces, few folks seem to understand the task at hand or the stakes or not meeting those cuts.
Anyone else feeling this way?
Do you have any success stories for getting colleagues or friends on board with real climate action?",1694122272.0,7,0,,"[""I've been doing climate activism with XR for the last 15 months and I have only one successful experience of mobilizing one friend among the many I've invited to events, actions and presentations. I think it really is related to personal risk perception and sensitivity: they either don't realize how much bad it is or if they do, they decide just not to care or think about it. I found even myself included on this mechanism, at the point that starting to do activism, I softened my vegetarian diet, as if it could be a way to assume that being an activist is enough; at least in my case it's a defense mechanism because doing both at the same time would be a constant reminder to me of how much fucked up we are (I'm not that optimistic as you 😅) and it would too much just to even try."", ""Unfortunately, it's very easy to just not think about it"", ""I agree. I've always found it very strange, especially since taking effective action against global warming would be fairly easy for most of us (stop eating meat, don't use a car, don't fly, buy as little new things as possible, etc.), while the cost of doing nothing is so high. It's not like we need to go to war and potentially die. My grandfather was in the french resistance during WW2, that was hard. Compared to that, eating vegetables and buying a fucking bike is really easy.\n\nMy opinion is that it has a lot to do with propaganda. Every day, most of us are drowned in a ocean of pro-capitalist propaganda, mainly in the form of advertising. Amoung all that stuff, the information about the ecological disaster and the ways that we can fight it is very hard to hear, especially considering the fact that we don't really want to consider it, as it's very depressing. For a lot of people, this only creates a cognitive dissonance that's strong enough to have big psychological consequences (depression, eco-anxiety, etc.), but not strong enough for many of us to actually want to act."", 'I think in part is has to do with the fact that it is very hard to ""do"" something about it - in the concrete, personal sense.

Even with XR you need to be able to conceptualize how their strategy will work in a broader system, even though you are of course concretely interacting with the material (this is all regardless of the persona risk and media framing of XR, etc).

It\'s all too embedded in a system to be comprehensible, or in small enough chunks that people (feel as if they can) contribute something\\*. \n\n\\*I would even say that this goes as far as into the ""obvious culprits"" themselves - in Capitalism the system itself is at fault, in a way.']"

We need to get off the fossil fuel train, asap, for the multitude of reasons that keeps increasing every time I have a conversation with someone who knows something about the problem I hadn\'t heard of before.  \n\nAnd I\'m saying ""fossil fuel"" in particular, because it\'s not just oil.\n\nWith that in mind, I\'d like to hear which countries you mean that are close, because I can\'t imagine that happening, but I could be wrong.\n\nHere\'s why I can\'t imagine it:  \n\nOil is a multi-layer, multi-purpose, multi-product wonder drug. It\'s not just a single thing, each barrel contains parts that can only be used for a certain thing, not all of it for anything. There\'s only a limited amount of diesel you can get out of a single barrel, for example. The rest has to be either turned into other things, like petrol gas, asphalt and the like, or be thrown out. And you know how industries are, if they can get someone to pay for something, they won\'t just throw stuff away. So there are a gazillion things everywhere that are in motion right now as parts of making everything that comes out of a barrel into something, and using it. Tyres, medications. All sorts of things.  \n\nSo not only do you have to replace all the engines in cars, trucks, trains, cranes, ships and backup generators for hospitals etc etc with something else, you have to replace countless \\*parts\\* of things, from rubber hoses to washers, connectors and containers with other things as well. Some of those might be easier to replace than others. A lot of those don\'t \\*have\\* replacements right now, so we\'d have to find them first.  \n\nIn order to make a lot of the things we want to work still work without fossil fuels, we need to replace \\*at least\\* our electricity generation with non-fossil fuel ones. Great, that seems feasible, we can argue about whether or not we build a nuclear power station to bridge the time until we\'ve got everything solar\'d up or whatever, \\*but\\* - the moment we want to also get rid of \\*all\\* oil, we run into another problem. We suddenly need all the juice we got from diesel etc before from somewhere else. Even if we don\'t do that, even if we reduce the amount of cars on the road, have only sailing ships between continents, no planes, we\'d still have to transport so much stuff (including all the renewable energy generation items), build so much stuff (renewable power plants), we\'d also have to build a much, much bigger electricity grid to transmit all that power. You can\'t just simply put more electricity through the wires we already have, you need more wires. A lot more. And all the renewable stuff needs to be built from something, too. So mining and building have to continue, and they\'re energy hungry. Like, really, really hungry.\n\nIf we were to get rid of oil \\*first\\*, building anything new would be infinitely harder.\n\nThe biggest excavator in the world is not digging for oil, it\'s digging for coal. The biggest dump truck ever built is not a tanker, it\'s a mining truck.\n\nAnd oil is in a multitude of those things, everywhere.\n\nOil is so much harder to replace that the fossil fuel industry is sitting in their boardrooms having a belly laugh that we\'re attacking the much harder target and are making fools of ourselves trying to scale a vertical teflon mirror.  \n\n(and that\'s not even getting into the problem of ""Moloch"" that makes it impossible for even those companies that want to get out of that race to do something impactful)\n\nThat\'s why I can\'t imagine any country being even close to being oil-free. If you have some examples, I\'m all ears, because I could use some hope.', ""The fact that we can't get rid of fossil fuels FIRST is exactly why we have to take major control of these companies, not sure you are understanding me. Some countries were able to transition because they had other sources of energy and/or their own fuel reserves, here is a l[ink](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/11-countries-leading-the-charge-on-renewable-energy/), but I think you already know these countries.\n\nFor the US and other countries, it will be much harder due to deeper dependency and oil companies' control and influence. You saw what happened last year, Oil execs couldn't get exactly what they wanted so they artificially raised prices and created ridiculous inflation that everyone in turn blames on Biden. Unelected people can destroy our country on a whim, that is enough reason to exert controls over them and/or sue them and liquidate them.\n\nWe are probably always going to need some oil, but not enough for the powerful people that are fighting progress every step of the way ."", 'Hmm, yeah, thanks for that reminder - I wasn\'t aware of the level of innovation that had already been implemented, that is indeed reassuring.\n\nBeing a total spoilsport though, I think this isn\'t going far enough. In fact, I wonder if this is a distraction in some sense. Yes, of course, every ppm counts, but these activities look like procrasticleaning. This is similar to the US announcing its Gini coefficient saying ""all\'s well, people get lots of stuff and services and money, too!"" while in fact, the index doesn\'t count how much of the productivity and affordability is subsidised through cheap labour overseas. When in 2035, Germany says ""Ha! Look at us, 100% renewable! Look at our wind farms, look at our solar panels!"" where are they getting their intermittent supply from? If all European countries did that by 2035, there would be rolling brownouts whenever there isn\'t enough sunlight or wind going through to power those power plants - or they\'d still be running nuclear, have to have \\*massive\\* hydro storage, tidal generation or something of the sort (I\'m pretty sure Germany\'s coastline is too short and too shallow to facilitate that, but I might be wrong). If they wanted to use batteries, holy crap, where would all the lithium and other stuff come from and what would we have to blow into the atmosphere to get it?  \n\nThe ""feelgood trick"", I think, here is in the language. Germany (just sticking with that example) is talking about \\*their\\* energy generation. They\'ll import energy from elsewhere when the need arises, that\'s already how it works because production and consumption are not in sync, they can\'t be. Germany also can\'t ban all cars, trucks and trains, let alone planes, in the next 10 years. The proposal that I know of talks about no \\*new\\* fossil fuel cars from 2035. Doesn\'t specify anything about how the cars are made, what kind of carbon credits etc are going to be assigned to the manufacturing, the manufacturing of the ""carbon neutral fuels"" etc.\n\nChina announced they\'ll do ""everything in their power to combat climate change as long as it doesn\'t interfere with everyday life"" (paraphrasing here), so just like the US, the other biggest polluter in the world isn\'t going to do diddly squat and is going to supply us with cheap manufacturing to outsource our problems and our carbon emissions.\n\nThat\'s where I despair. It\'s a double whammy of the multitude of things we can\'t just take out of rotation without bringing everything crashing down (in a bad way) and the lack of leverage against those (and the unwillingness to admit how much we benefit from not holding them to account) who are doing the majority of the damage.']"

I’m Maddie, a university student from the UK, and one of the youth committee from #0beef.

Did you know that your canteen could cut its emissions by 40% per year with just a few simple
menu changes in their menu? - that’s the carbon equivalent of 136 024 economy class return air
journeys between London and New York every year.

Thanks to the experience we have working with institutions like the University of Cambridge,
and schools like North London Collegiate School and Eltham Hill School in Greenwich, we can
help to guide your canteen and service staff in the transition.- but we need your help to get the
movement started.

We’d love to be able to help to make it easy for you to make a major positive impact on your
university's carbon footprint. Check out our website to find out more.(0beef.com).

If you’d like to lend a hand to grow this campaign, drop me a message either on here, or on Instagram (@0beef) so we can set up a call :)

This direction has brought you and your crew a lot of benefits, like money, power, and control. But there\'s a problem: the ship is slowly heading towards a dangerous storm, and you know it could cause a lot of damage.\n\nNow, you might wonder, ""Why wouldn\'t they just change course to avoid the storm?"" Well, there are some reasons that might make them hesitate:\n\n--Short-Term Gains vs. Long-Term Challenges: --Changing the ship\'s course might mean giving up some of the benefits you\'re enjoying right now. For example, using fossil fuels and certain industries might bring in money quickly, but shifting away from them might seem expensive and difficult in the short term, even if it\'s better for the long-term health of the ship (the planet).\n\n--Uncertainty and Denial:-- Some leaders might question whether the storm is really as bad as the forecasts say. It\'s like someone saying, ""It might not be that bad, let\'s wait and see."" This uncertainty can lead to denial or downplaying the problem, especially if they feel the storm won\'t hit during their time in charge.\n\n--Influence and Status Quo:--People who are already benefiting from the ship\'s current direction might have a lot of power and influence. They might not want things to change because it could mean they have to share their resources or influence with others. So, they might resist changing course to protect their own interests.\n\n--Political and Economic Pressures:-- World leaders often need to think about elections and the economy. Changing course might mean making tough decisions that could upset some people or affect jobs in certain industries. This can make leaders hesitant, especially if they fear backlash from powerful groups.\n\n--Lack of Immediate Consequences:-- Sometimes, the effects of the storm (climate change) aren\'t felt right away. It\'s like a slow-building problem that might not directly impact leaders during their time in power. This can make it easier for them to put off taking action.\n\n--Global Cooperation Challenges:-- Climate change is a global issue that requires cooperation between many countries and industries. Leaders might worry that if they take big steps alone, it could put them at a disadvantage compared to others who aren\'t taking such steps.\n\nSo, while many leaders do understand the seriousness of climate change, there are various reasons why they might not be taking swift and aggressive actions. It\'s often a mix of short-term benefits, uncertainty, existing power dynamics, and concerns about the economy and politics. However, the hope lies in raising awareness, building public pressure, and finding ways to convince these leaders that addressing climate change is not just necessary for the planet\'s well-being, but also for the long-term stability and prosperity of their own societies.\n\n*This response was generated from a prompt by chat gpt cause i\'m a dumb trades worker, ha.*', '**Governments and big corporates have to act!**\n\nI am a climate activist and I care deeply about the planet and nature.

&#x200B;

I just had a thought I would like to share:

I feel like there isn't one ""universal"" carbon footprint score, and if there was, and if it could be somehow verified, people could share their score similar to how they share their social media links, etc. which would reveal how much impact on the environment each person is making.

Which in turn would expose people that life the ""overly-fancy"" lifestyle, as well as people that live the ""overly-minimal"" lifestyle.

Virtually all of which traditionally eat meat, and are doing so in a respectable way both towards the animal and the world. Now obviously industrilized meat production is not respectfull towards anyone or anything, and it is the only way to produce the amount of meat required by the current and predicted levels of consumption. But if we manage to shift to eating less meat, that will open up space for more sustainable ways (for example, as a by product of way of upcycling).\n\nIn terms of making a difference in the world, inspiring others, I think you might have more succes eating a little meat than eating no animal products at all.

Now let\'s pretend that replacing meat with veg is accomplished, and total agricultural land under cultivation is reduced by 76%.\n\nWhat would happen at that point? Would the freed-up land be left alone and allowed to go wild and nurture biodiversity? No, industrial concerns and governments and citizens would cheer how much new space is available and want to ""make use"" of it: mining, housing people, generating electricity, placing hospitals and schools, laying roads, etc. The (civilized) human population will be grown, and all non-civilized life (from people to insects) will be pushed out.\n\nThe ""victory"" of transitioning to plant based would last about 0.002 seconds before technological society crept in and negated any gains. So what is it worth?\n\nAnd I should clarify that I wasn\'t saying too much land is used for growing veg, so I don\'t think it actually is ""the other way around""; I was saying that replacing humanity\'s meat calories with veg calories is no significant improvement, because continuing to produce food to feed the worldwide human population is a problem when it fails *and* when it succeeds. It would still sequester land for exclusive use by civilized humans; the land has to be transformed and made to yield great quantities of a single crop, often using chemical fertilizers. None of that improves biodiversity. It isn\'t how Nature operates, and we aren\'t really improving from our crisis situation if we are not becoming more aligned with Nature.', ""Red meat is carcinogenic and contributes to increased rates of heart disease and diabetes.

Can we eat meat and be healthy, absolutely yes, can we not eat meat and be healthy, absolutely yes.\n\nIs it bad for the environment for most people to be that way, unequivocally yes, but I'm not here to change your thoughts or habits. Our meat production is overall bad for the environment, I don't think that can be argued away. \n\nI also don't like this whole 'we're born this way' argument either. \nPredatory apes do a whole lot of things that aren't allowed in human culture even if they still happen, but we agree as a CULTURE that they're unacceptable and even punishable, so what's 'natural' isn't always what we agree to be 'right'. And we do a whole lot of things that predatory apes would, or could, ever do. In terms of diet we have grocery stores where you can find any food any time of the year, we eat processed foods, refined sugars; none of that is natural in any way, and BECAUSE it's not natural we then have the CHOICE to either eat meat or not, and still live good and healthy lives. We don't have to scavenge. There have been many HUMAN cultures throughout history that have eaten little to no meat. We're not apes, and haven't really been apes since the agricultural revolution which was what, like 12000 years ago? \n\nBut look, you eat meat, that's fine. I don't care. It's just this is the exact type of argument that comes up EVERY SINGLE TIME someone suggest that vegetarianism is possible. You fly off and say no human could do it based off your own unproven theories, when that's resoundingly been proven wrong. You can eat meat, and others can not eat meat. Eating meat is shown to be bad for the environment, it takes more land, produces methane, contaminates food, creates diseases that sometimes get passed to humans. Our practices are bad. We don't live in harmony with the earth. It's not good. We're not lions hunting in the savana man."", ""Natural history is not a mandate. Nature tells us nothing about what we should be so I disagree with the premise of your argument. \n\nIt's possible for us to get nutrition from vegan sources through careful supplementation and I don't think that that is a problem in itself. \n\nI just wanted to note publically that I don't agree with your line of reasoning."", '>Why would I ask ranchers if their practices are sustainable?\n\nThis indicates a reading problem, if not a cognitive problem. You wrote ""Local is completely irrelevant if you are eating beef, lamb or cheese."" to which I replied, ""Tell that to a rancher."" Because ranchers with cattle or lamb do have them locally, so your statement that ""local is irrelevant"" is totally foolish. Nobody ever wrote about asking ranchers for the sustainable quality of their work. It\'s amazing (in a sad way) how frequently occurring is the drastic misinterpretation of very plain, simple statements. Embarrassing, really.\n\n>You seem to think that inconvenient empirical science can just be disregarded\n\nLol, no I do not. Your displayed inability to read and process my very basic statements doesn\'t much validate that you can accurately interpret my position.\n\nImagine going to the people living in Nature, fully sustainable but non-vegan, and telling them about ""Scientific studies say you need to not hunt monkeys and tapirs and instead import wheat - and the scientists know, you don\'t!"" Absurd, and arrogant. And wrong.\n\nI don\'t care to continue with you, you cannot (or will not) even read and process what I put down, just believe whatever bizarre nonsense that you desire.', 'If CCS doesn\'t have to be used and there are cheaper alternatives that is a good thing. The technology behind CCS is sound, but it will be a novel application in most industries that need it. The study you\'re linking lists the alternatives (which may or may not be cheaper) as \'low-TRL\', and in the paragraph before that has CCS as higher TRL. So yes CCS is harder than it looks, but it\'s still the easiest option. \n\nWe have about 12 years to reduce industrial emissions by two thirds (which is a Conservative target) and this will have to include large parts of the cement and lime industries. To put that into perspective, ""[*it can take between 20 and almost 70 years for new energy technologies to go from first prototype to materiality (that is, to reach 1% of a national market)*](https://www.iea.org/reports/clean-energy-innovation/innovation-needs-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario)"", and cement/lime new investment cycles could be up to a third into that. This is why we have to focus on the technology we currently have available, whilst continuing to research other ways of doing things. If you check out the funding for the author\'s work, it\'s exactly the same people who are currently investing in CCS for the lime industry [and have put it in their decarbonisation roadmap](https://www.mineralproducts.org/MPA/media/root/Publications/2023/Lime_Net_Negative_2040_Roadmap.pdf).', ""That's not true. The study says the people were vegetarian and abstained from alcohol and smoking.\n\nThat's the reason they lived longer. \nNot the poor quality diet."", '> US housing can\'t expand much more... with 76% less land used for agriculture...\n\nIf 76% of present agricultural lands are no longer used for food production, they will be put to other uses for the desires of civilization, and quite possibly ""affordable homes"". Nothing in policy, law, present or historical activity indicates that the land will be allowed to be wild and harbor biodiversity. It would be contrary to the whole modus operandi of civilization. It is entirely implausible that anything ecologically beneficial will occur after a transition to plant-based frees us to no longer need 76% of current land to generate our calories. It simply won\'t happen, nothing validates a presumption of the land being returned to wildlife. As the human population rises, the land may well become new growth area for more veg. If the laboratories takeover food creation, the land will be made to do other things for technological society. The extermination of Nature is the agenda, it\'s not an accident because we need to make food and if we could make it without killing Nature we would. No, all the land will be converted to uses for machine-society, until Nature eventually has no further existence.\n\nThe same is true when people are paid more: they don\'t maintain their old standard of living and save more of their income, they spend more. They do this *and* that. The same is true with ""green energy"": it doesn\'t *replace* fossil fuels, it *adds to* the total ability for electrical power generation. No oil or coal or natural gas deposits are foresaken and bypassed, they are still exploited but *also* we have windmills and solar panels adding to the generation of electricity.\n\nThe only way to save Nature is to destroy the technological system.', '> you like to eat meat\n\nThat isn\'t true, certainly not as a general rule, and it is not at all ""the core"" of my position. Does every chimp *like* to eat smaller animals? I don\'t know, but it benefits to do so and it is disadvantaged to avoid doing so. Humans benefit to eat animals and we are harmed to never do so. *That* is *one* major point of my argument against veganism.\n\n> meat production is overall bad for the environment\n\nYou\'re honed-in on the *meat* aspect and I\'m saying it\'s actually the *production* aspect. I expect you know of how damaging it has been for the rainforests and orangutans of Indonesia that demand for palm oil (vegan) has surged, but are you aware that rice paddies are also an eco-disaster? Do you know that acres of wheat and corn and potatoes and beets are severely detrimental as well? Does it help or harm biodiversity to grow fields of exclusively oats (or hemp, or soy, or almonds) and then send them to a factory to be crushed and mixed with water for \'vegan milks\'?  (And do you think it is only coincidence that these ecologically detrimental vegan monocrop plantations are completely unnatural?)\n\n> apes do a whole lot of things that aren\'t allowed in human culture... they\'re unacceptable and even punishable\n\nMost of what has been ruled punishable is not necessarily bad or anti-social but simply disruptive to smooth operation of mass-society, where strangers with different cultures, values, and beliefs. Laws came about with empires which subsumed conquered cultures. This isn\'t to be defended, I don\'t think.\n\n> what\'s \'natural\' isn\'t always what we agree to be \'right\'.\n\nI completely disagree. If humanity lives within the bounds set by Nature, we have a future. If we try to steer the world to suit us, we kill everything and foreclose having a future on Earth.\n\n> ...we have grocery stores where you can find any food any time of the year, we eat processed foods, refined sugars; none of that is natural in any way\n\nAnd none of that is good, or sustainable. Do you not see the pattern of a common link?\n\n> we have the CHOICE to either eat meat or not... We don\'t have to scavenge.\n\nBut we should. There is nothing unsustainable or detrimental about it. It\'s good for Nature, for a future of living on a healthy Earth, and it\'s good for us. We won\'t start scavenging while all the concrete and plastic and farms and roads surround us, we\'ll have to get rid of that stuff. Veganism is not taking us nearer to that day, but making us further dependent upon complex and fragile systems of production, transport, economics, and politics all working smoothly.\n\n> There have been many HUMAN cultures throughout history that have eaten little to no meat.\n\nThis would be intersting and enlightening to hear more about. But as regards this sub and the goal of saving Nature, the ""many human cultures"" you refer to did not save Nature (from Technology\'s assaults) by their pseudo-veganism.\n\n> EVERY SINGLE TIME someone suggest that vegetarianism is possible. You fly off and say no human could do it based off your own unproven theories\n\nI never once suggested nobody can do it. And yet you emphasize ""every single time""... Veganism can be done without technological aids (supplements, diet plan, blood work, nutritional component analysis) and it can be done in one bioregion. But it can\'t be done naturally, just foraging what Nature provides in a bioregion - that isn\'t true of a traditional human diet, which includes meats. And I don\'t think veganism is healthful for a human.\n\nOne thing to consider around the health aspect is that skulls from 20K years ago always have all their teeth, whereas today we cannot keep our teeth even through our lives. How is it that omnivorous cavemen lacking dental care didn\'t have rotting teeth and periodontis, as we do *despite* our advanced dental-protection systems? Well, the bacteria which destroy dental health come from carbohydrates, which modern life is full of (and vegans are greatly consuming).\n\nAnother note on health is that diversity is good. Whether in civilization or locally in Nature, removing the range of animal-derived edibles for humans is decreasing the dietary diversity available.\n\n> Eating meat is shown to be bad for the environment, it takes more land, produces methane, contaminates food, creates diseases that sometimes get passed to humans.\n\nThere\'s yet another mistaken conflation. *Eating* meat is not ""bad for the environment..."" and all the rest; *producing* meat is terrible for Nature. But technological civilization is a misaligned with Nature, so producing *anything* is detrimental (and unnecessary).\n\n> Our practices are bad. We don\'t live in harmony with the earth. It\'s not good. We\'re not lions hunting in the savana man.\n\nAgreed.', ""> The technology behind CCS is sound\n\nCareful for other people reading this: CCS is an umbrella of technologies that need to be evaluated individually. Here, some processes lead to CO2 that is relatively easy to capture compared to e.g a coal plant, so that's nice.\n\n> We have about 12 years to reduce industrial emissions by two thirds\n\nAbout half of cement's emissions come from fossil fuels, which are quite easy to substitute. With this and a reduction in demand (alternative construction materials, different concrete mixes) it looks like we could reach this target of two thirds quickly and without even touching process emissions - not to say that we shouldn't start to address them as well.\n\nYou have a good point about investment cycles. I hope that policies enable all of the above quickly.\n\nFor industrial emissions overall, I hear that heat pumps and [thermal storage](https://www.volts.wtf/p/why-electrifying-industrial-heat#details) are a big part of the solution."", 'Look at the whole [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/648593), especially table 3. The risk factors are analyzed separately. Not everyone was vegetarian, so one of the comparisons is between vegetarians and nonvegetarians.\n\nA more interesting critique would be to compare several vegetarian/vegan populations. If you compare these vegetarian adventists with UK vegetarians, they follow different diets and UK vegetarians are less healthy (closer to UK average). So a vegetarian diet *can* be protective, but not all vegetarian diets are great.', ""So, your follow up is going back to a scavenger society is the way and modern society can all eat meat WITHOUT producing it somehow.

See the China study. \n\nBeing vegetarian can easily be done without all your wild medical work,I think you know that. Societies have done it.

Not without dishonesty. Can you say that healthful veg*ism can be done today on a natural level, without reliance on technologies? Because people certainly can avoid buying meat and simply hunt what lives around them - and if we save Nature (through the necessary destruction of technological society), we\'ll be at that level, and nobody will choose to avoid eating local animals (because the local veg is insufficient sustenance for a human).\n\n>you seem fixated on some pre agriculture utopia.

No, ""modern society"" (8B+ people) *cannot* ""all eat meat"" or any other thing. Nature provides food overall, but not all things to all people at all times. At some times, some people will eat capybara, some will eat zebra, some will eat seal, some will eat snake, etc. Some will have oranges, some will have dill, some will find berries, and so on. It will not be *produced* be people to any significant degree: people here and there will have plots which they tend and grow food or raise animals upon. But where able, most people will probably roam and forage and hunt seasonally, a presumption based on how most humans lived.\n\nBut 8B people will not exist in a sustainable future on this planet. And IDK what you mean by ""follow up"".\n\n>Also why are we harmed by not eating animals? It\'s been shown by large studies that animal products harm us.\n\nI\'ve already mentioned a couple negative health effects. Today\'s studies get refuted by tomorrow\'s, old ideas are tossed out. I take in the present science but do not live and die by it. If eating animals is unhealthy, please explain the healthy tribal societies which hunted and even ate raw/fresh the organs. (We ought to eat more organs rather than merely the muscles; predators prioritize the organs and not the muscles.)\n\nUsing logic, if a species evolved doing/eating X, then you (for some reason) swap X for B, the species is probably not improved. This is the civilized notion that we know best, and can improve upon Nature\'s ruling of Earth, a premise I reject.\n\n>Being vegetarian can easily be done without all your wild medical work,I think you know that. Societies have done it.\n\nIt can be done but you will be missing several important nutrients which are best obtained from animal sources. Fats and B12 are the main ones which come to mind. Between an omnivore and a vegan, both eating natural (nonprocessed) foods and lacking knowledge of nutrition, my money would be bet on the vegan missing his nutritional needs and sooner having ill health than the omnivore. The omnivore is eating a wider range of materials.\n\nNon-human animals eat all sorts of things that we cannot, and their bodies process such things that we can absorb those elements and benefit from them when we consume the animals. A vegan relies on supplements and at least mild ""wild medical work"".\n\nI welcome your exposition about the ""many human cultures"" who have done a pseudo-vegetarian lifestyle.', 'Tone is hard to get right on the internet.

Thus there are whole teams of enforcers with all sorts of special powers who try to catch us breaking the regulation of driving speeds, and then we get punished - but even the enforcers know that they catch only a small fraction of the speeders. It would be far more effective for a govt to allow only cars with a max speed capability equal to the speeds allowed by law. The number of personnel put to enforcement could then be reduced.

But when the technologies remain in existence - even with heavy regulations - then it is very difficult to control where they go, who gets them, and how they are used.\n\nCompanies in the USA create cybersecurity or hacking software, or military hardware; they\'re allowed to sell their products only after approval from the U.S. government, and they are not allowed to sell their powerful technologies to competitor nations such as China. But that doesn\'t mean China won\'t try to develop the tech themselves, even spying and stealing and bribing and blackmailing to get the development details in order to not have to start at square one.\n\nAnd even with all the incentive that every government has for keeping info of its technological powers from its enemies and competitors, the rules requiring a review by the govt before any proposed sale can occur are not set in stone, they can be fully disregarded or totally changed or even revoked.\n\nThis is why legislation and ""regulations"" are inadequate.\n\nAnd if your nation forbids the international sale of airplanes or cars, then your nation will be economically hampered, not making sales - and if it\'s possible, some other provider will make themselves known to those seeking.

And if your enemies have airplanes and cars, then you need to have them, lest you be completely outmatched in power potential.\n\nThis is how we come to the conclusion that the only sufficient remedy for the problem of technology is a *global* *forced regression*, i.e., a revolution to destroy all technological capacity worldwide so that it cannot continue as it did, incrementally eliminating our freedoms and eradicating Nature.\n\nIndeed we *do* need to force the end of airlines and cars and power plants, but not merely via legislation or government, and not while leaving in existence the ability for these technologies continue somewhere else in the world, in locales beyond one nation\'s government.', ""Legumes don't make a solid, healthy human animal, and there is nothing wrong about preying upon other creatures, it's what most apes do, certainly our type of ape is evolved for it, and only recently did the vegan dogma take hold and convince people - but only those in civilization - that we ought to alter our traditional diets for veganism."", 'No.  I don’t eat beans as a protein source.  A lot of people do not.  I can however, grow my own chickens and take care of my own protein needs, but you need to understand a couple things about agriculture in the South and ‘rewilding’ land.  \n\nRewilding the land is a nice idea, but I don’t think that will do much at this point.  We can replant trees and plants, but even native plants will struggle their first few years of growth.  If there’s drought and too much heat it will kill the seedlings and the project will fail if the climate can’t sustain it.  So right now, I think that would be a bad idea, unless there’s a particular reason for a specific area.  \n\nVegetable crops are not how farmers make money.  They make money from their contracts to farm animals through Murphy Brown, Case, Prestige Farms, etc.  Most of the vegetables we eat (at least where I live) come from South America or grown near mount Popo in Mexico.  All the corn, soybeans, wheat planted here gets used for animal agriculture.  Even then, these crops are more like ‘bumper’ crops to keep the soil from eroding and if they’re lucky, a little extra cash for the farmer, but they barely break even growing that shit.  So, since they don’t grow food in this capacity for humans, they’d likely have to deforest more land to be able to grow what we’d need.  \n\nThey’re not going to continue growing anything if we take their animal contracts.  The animal contracts are how they afford their half a million dollar brick home and 200k boat, even though the median income in my town is 42k 👀, but I digress.  \n\nI’ve been telling them for years it’s coming.  When a lot of these factory farming contractors started mergers and selling companies, it alarmed me a great deal that people seemed to be cool with these companies selling out to Chinese businessmen.  We know how foreigners treat land where they won’t have to live.  Poorly.  \n\nI’ve been encouraging them to look into lab grown meats, because that’s what will kill the factory farm industry.  If they try to invest and be a part of that industry, it could save their livelihoods.  But they don’t think meat-grown labs is a legitimate business.  When there is no profit left, China will sell off these companies or simply dissolve into bankruptcy and we will be left with poisoned land and polluted water.  They don’t think this is a possibility.  It’s already happening though.  \n\nThe point is, we cannot make people do anything.  We can’t force these farmers to grow things they don’t want to, they’ll just grow nothing, because like I said, we don’t get our vegetables from these people.  We have to do it.  We have to start growing our own food and raising a few animals here and there.  We have to become the famers and land stewards because these people really don’t give a fuck.  They do not believe me, and if they do happen to believe me, the don’t care they’ll go to heaven when they die, so it doesn’t matter to them.', 'I did', 'You really like killing don’t you lol', ""You really think you know better than Nature and evolution don't you lol"", 'Ya']"

The luck they've had thus far will not prevail forever.\n\nLike successful revolutionaries of history, we must organize now, to agitate and exacerbate the existing social conflicts, and to prepare for a more severe future faltering of the system, at which time - with the efforts of smart and serious revolutionaries dedicated to saving Nature - the system's instability can be pushed to total collapse, beyond salvation by any social sector with an interest in its continuation."", ""We're in agreement here.

Roger Hallam provides more specifics but I don\'t regard that as beneficial, for a few reasons.\n\nA step-by-step guide to falling down the stairs is not preferable to a more vague guide to going up the stairs. A coach doesn\'t lay out a step-by-step guide for the players to achieve victory in the match, and it is an essential point that like a team of athletes, revolutionaries need to be adaptable and ready to act in a variety of ways as they may become available. They need to not be locked-in to a rigid program of steps: revolutionaries are but catalysts, and it is the society (with all its many interrelated parts) which provides the reactive material. Since society is too complex to be entirely predictable, revolutionaries must be attentive and opportunistic.\n\nThe agitation should be constant, reminding the public of the problem (Technology) and the existence of an extremist oppositional group championing the only useful solution, but the conditions of the climactic moment for action against the system cannot exactly be spelled-out and noted ahead of time, because the tumult and instability may take many forms. Any day might bring an overreaction or misstep from government which could be ""the straw to break the camel\'s back"", as could an ecological or economic development beyond the control or remedy of any social sector.\n\nThe 1979 revolution in Iran is one example Kaczynski does not cite in *Anti-Tech Revolution*, but it is quite instructive. The socialists of Iran (many operating from exile in France, through Iranian proxies, and with underground guerrilla cells in Iran) were perhaps the clear vanguard of anti-Shah sentiment and the primary challengers of the regime - and yet the Islamists were the ones to take power. According to people involved in stoking the revolution, both the Islamists and the socialists (imprisoned together) never imagined that the Islamists would soon take power in Tehran, and in fact the socialists largely regarded Sheik Khomeini as a doddering old buffoon. A detailed step-by-step guide would not have shown the process that actually played-out in Iran, and thus it would have been detrimental for revolutionaries to think they could adhere to such a planned program.', "">A step-by-step guide to falling down the stairs is not preferable to a more vague guide to going up the stairs\n\nI've been listening to more of the podcast.

Forbes: Humans are causing a potential Mass-Extinction Event,,44,155p8tp,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2023/07/19/modern-sixth-mass-extinction-event-will-be-worse-than-first-predicted/?sh=82858ab4ab65,11,"This article published yesterday by Forbes does not go along with my theme of an exciting future and I have tried to dismiss it rather than post.
I can’t, and neither should you. It’s from Forbes Magazine and is packed full of credible scientific evidence. The report argues that nearly half of the planet’s animal species are now in decline, but unlike past mass extinctions, this one has been entirely caused by humans.

Tragically, the global mass extinction event that we find ourselves in the midst of will be even worse than originally predicted, according to a recent study (ref). The international team of scientists came to their conclusion after analyzing population trends data for more than 71,000 animal species — including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects — from around the world to see how their numbers have changed since record-keeping first began.
Generally, scientists agree that an extinction event is occurring when species vanish much faster than they are replaced. A mass extinction event is usually defined as losing 75% of the world’s species in a short period of geological time — less than 2.8 million years, according to the Natural History Museum (here).
Previous research has established that the current rates of extinction are between 1000-10,000 times higher than ‘background’ extinction rates, which has led some scientists to argue that life on Earth has entered its sixth mass extinction event. But uniquely, when compared to the planet’s previous five mass extinction events, this is the first mass extinction event that is the result of the actions of just one species — humans.
Globally, many species are declining as the result of a variety of destructive human activities, particularly habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, the widespread use of pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals, and the effects of invasive species, aggravated by runaway climate change.
Please view the Original Forbes Article to continue reading.",1689948869.0,44,0,,"[""Unfortunately, that is old news. We have been in the middle of a mass extinction event for some time.

It only get worse from here', '> in the middle of a mass extinction\n\nWe\'re in a climate and biodiversity crisis, there\'s no doubt that, but almost certainly not a mass extinction event. \n\nThe thing about mass extinction events, is they\'re massive. It\'s not a few species, or even a few thousand species dying off, it\'s most of the earth\'s biosphere. Once a mass extinction event starts, it can\'t really be stopped, since the extinction of certain species has a sort of cascading effect. E.g. if all the worms die off, the birds do as well. \n\nWe are in a biodiversity crisis, that could lead to a mass extinction event if nothing is done. But saying we\'re already in a mass extinction event is problematic, both because it\'s misleading, and because it actually gives people an excuse to not care about the issue. E.g.

The planet has experienced five previous mass extinction events, the last one occurring 65.5 million years ago which wiped out the dinosaurs from existence.

Make COP28 Vegan!,Tuotus,17,153wbdu,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/153wbdu/make_cop28_vegan/,2,"If we expect the world to adopt a plant-based diet for climate crisis, the first steps for it would have to be taken by the people in power, people in-charge and people leading the movement. If COPs are representative for the world for what it needs to do, then they need to put that in action and not just in words. So, we should demand for COP28 and so forth to represent that values. 

When it comes to food systems, their role is not just important in terms of reducing emissions but ensuring food security for the planet. Is a largely livestock based agricultural system feasible for us to maintain. Around 727,000 cattles died in Pakistan floods in addition to the human lives lost and crops and wildlife destruction. Now, a cattle can take up to 2 years just to be mature for milk and meat production usually. This along with the high initial investment and feeding costs, that's a huge level of loss for a small-scale farmer. That's not just food security gone but income security, people even invest their future savings in these animals hoping to see a return over time. I don't see any discussion around climate-smart agriculture in my country. And the focus of the government is on corporate livestock farming right now. I don't know but I think that is not going to go well for our people most of whom are relying on wheat, and crop staples to survive here. Animal products are expensive. I think pressure from international forums to make these changes could benefit us as a country which is likely to become an extractive economy even in agriculture sector now. So, like yeah I think cop28 or any other international conferences prioritise food systems as well as they are really vital as well for the survival of low income communities and I would like to sign this petition, make this part of your protest agenda or whatever. Like I know I'm vegan but the biggest reason I went into environmentalism and then veganism is due to studying food insecurity and how broken our current system is. It is literally built for rich-upper class who can actually afford to consume expensive products regularly and doesn't account for the nutrient insufficiency that would be part of low-income diet due to that. So yeah, I hope this gets talked more and not just from the perspective of cow farts.

They too have been blocking highways, usually by using slow driving farm equipment. The first time they did this, it led to the largest traffic jam in Dutch history. After that they had impromptu blockades sometimes using the farm equipment, sometimes dumping garbage and asbestos on the highways. These are a massive inconvenience, because they blockade not the end of the highway, but the middle of it, stopping all cars going one way. The garbage and asbestos (often on fire) are even more dangerous. They did not announce these blockades, they just happened. Police usually reacted by waiting till they were done (one time a cop shot at a tractor, but it's been wildly criticized and everyone agrees the cop should not have done that), or playing Twister with the farmers and joining their BBQ. A handful of the farmers (and farmer sympathisers) that have been arrested (usually days or weeks after the fact) gotten fines or community service. As far as I can see, only one person has been tried for the same thing they want to try the ER members for: inciting a blockade of a highway.

/r/ExtinctionRebellion will be going dark from June 12-14 in protest against Reddit's API changes which kill 3rd party apps.,veneratio5,105,1409p9g,ExtinctionRebellion,/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/,4,,1685876798.0,105,0,,"['Hi all, we\'ll be following in the footsteps of /r/videos, outlined in [this post here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/145vns0/the_future_of_rvideos/)\n\n""Hello everyone, I’ll try to keep this short as I know there’s been a lot going on over the last few days. When we made [our announcement last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/13zqcua/rvideos_will_be_going_dark_from_june_1214_in/), we intended to get Reddit\'s attention on a subject that our team found extremely concerning. /r/Videos is joining a larger coordinated protest and signing an [open letter to the admins found here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/145l7wp/todays_ama_with_spez_did_nothing_to_alleviate/)\n\nThe announcement was of exceedingly high API prices which we all know was to intentionally kill 3rd party applications on reddit (Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Boost, Relay, etc.) Since that post several things have become clear; Reddit is not willing to listen to its users or the mod teams from many of its largest communities on this matter. Yesterday all major third-party Reddit apps announced that they would be shutting down on the 30th of June due to these changes. There were no negotiations and Reddit refused to extend the deadlines. The rug was pulled out from under them and by extension all of the users who rely on those tools to use reddit.\n\nIn addition to this, [the AMA hosted by Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit,](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/) which was intended to alleviate concerns held by many users about these issues, was nothing short of a collage of inappropriate responses. There are many things to take away from this AMA but [here are the key points.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/145l7wp/todays_ama_with_spez_did_nothing_to_alleviate/) Most disappointingly it appears that Reddit outright misconstrued the actions of Apollo\'s creator /u/iamthatis by saying that [he threatened Reddit and leaked private phone calls,](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk45rr/) something done only to clear his name of another accusation.\n\nSo what’s happening? The TL;DR? Effective tomorrow (6/11/2023), /r/Videos will be restricting posting capabilities. Anything posted before the cut off date will likely be the final front page of our community before we go private indefinitely. In the unlikely scenario that Reddit ownership has a sudden change of heart and capitulates on their decisions we will reopen, but until that happens /r/Videos will stay closed. Many other communities have come to similar decisions and we support those who have decided to take a stand.\n\n___\n\n**Short FAQ:**\n\n**Q: Won’t Reddit just remove you as moderators and reopen the subreddit?**\n\n> A: This is a distinct possibility, Reddit has made it clear that the “health” of their site is more important to them. We as a team are prepared for this, none of us want to continue to volunteer for a company that disrespects the people who helped build it into the front page of the internet.\n\n**Q: An indefinite lockdown? I thought this was only supposed to be for 48 hours?**\n\n> A: Originally it was our intention to spread awareness of these issues, but over the past week it has become clear that Reddit doesn’t intend to act in good faith, and our role in the protest became clear. The owners of Reddit have taken their users, community developers, and their moderator teams for granted and used them to build up a multimillion dollar company which is now focused not on the community, but on how many commas they can get out of Silicon Valley investors.\n\n**Q: What can we as users do to support this protest?**\n\n> A: The best way you can make your opinion known is by stopping using reddit. At the very least you can try and reduce your usage of the site, consider using alternatives such as [Tildes](https://tildes.net/) which I’ve personally found to be a nice change of pace from the traditional Reddit experience.\n\nP.S.

"If 1,000 People Could Join Together to Fight Climate Change - What Is the Best Action They Could Take?",Paction_Josh,40,13ybdxg,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/13ybdxg/if_1000_people_could_join_together_to_fight/,11,"Hi r/ExtinctionRebellion,

u/Paction_David and I have been working on an online tool for collective action which we believe could be a game changer for political and climate action. We would really like your support as we develop the tool and run our first pilots.

[paction.org.uk](https://paction.org.uk/)

\-----

How it works

* ***The Pact***: A user describes a collective action which they believe will solve a common problem or  
provide a public good.
* ***Critical Mass***: Action only occurs if enough people have joined the pact.
* ***Commitment Bond***: If you don’t take part, you must donate to a charity specified in the pact.

(See [here](https://pact.paction.org.uk/) for some examples)

\-----

*Use cases which you might find interesting include*

**Political Action:** A pact can encourage participation in various campaigns including protests, civil disobedience, awareness raising (public stunts), or tactical voting.

**Consumer Advocacy:** Consumers could group together to challenge the power of large corporations. Groups can switch from one service to another (e.g. towards green pensions), take part in debt strikes (e.g. against banks which finance fossil fuels)  or disrupt commercial activities (e.g. energy companies).

**Behaviour Change:** Acting as part of a larger group may encourage people towards more sustainable activities.

If you have any ideas for a pact, please feel free to get one started.

**Is ending climate change enough to save us from extinction? Will A.I. and the other horrors of modern technology not remain as continuing threats to humanity and wild Nature even if powered by renewable energy sources?**

The Anti-Tech Collective will host an open discussion meeting via Zoom, to introduce the anti-tech position which advocates hastening the demise of the worldwide techno-industrial system.

Dr. David Skrbina, professor on the philosophy of technology, will explain the case for the dismantling of modern technological society, and answer questions about the anti-tech ideology made most famous by the revolutionary Dr. Theodore Kaczynski.

**While designed as an introduction for people unfamiliar with the anti-tech ideology, all are welcome to participate and raise questions.**

So when vegans try to gate keep environmentalism, it feels like they're doing exactly what fossil fuel companies want them to do.\n\nHowever, this is where things get nuanced. Vegans generally like to focus on the individual because veganism at its core is an ethical belief system. So a lot of the language used by vegans focuses on individual agency and accountability regarding the abuse of animals.\n\nIf we instead forget about veganism and focus instead on a universally agreed upon plant based food system, it becomes very relevant to environmentalism. Think of a plant based food system similar to how we think about renewable energy. We're not going to get rid of fossil fuels by convincing everyone to go off the grid and we're not going to get rid of the meat and dairy industry by asking people to drink oat milk instead of cows milk.\n\nWhat we can do is show people the real statistics regarding our food and energy systems and pressure our governments into transitioning to sustainable systems.\n\nA plant based food system would reduce our agricultural land use by 70% and instantly solve our overfishing problem.

The 75% of land that you would no longer need - 3 billion hectares land, an area 3 times the size of the USA - if not used for animal ag, could be left to rewild and sequester carbon. That would not only be amazingly valuable for saving the life support systems of our ecosystem, but it would also sequester a gigantic amount of CO2.\n\nIn fact it would sequester 26 billion tons per year, or 65% of total current emissions. And it would do this for at least 30 years, pulling down 780 billion tons of CO2. For context, that's  twice the current emissions budget for hitting 1.5C. That number is so big that, along with halfway decent emissions reductions, it would actually reverse most of the damage we have already done.\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000010\n\nPut another way, if you count both the 15% of direct emissions from animal ag, and the 65% opportunity cost of using the land in that way, animal ag represents the opportunity to cut current emissions by 80%.\n\nHonestly I have been reading this research for years now.

Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources and are associated with much less environmental damage. \n\nhttps://www.bda.uk.com/resource/british-dietetic-association-confirms-well-planned-vegan-diets-can-support-healthy-living-in-people-of-all-ages.html\n\n> One of the UK’s longest-standing organisations that represents dietetics and nutrition, the British Dietetic Association, has affirmed that a well-planned vegan diet can “support healthy living in people of all ages” in an official document signed by its CEO.\n\nSo please stop baselessly asserting that vegan diets are not healthful."", 'Sounds delicious!', 'i don’t want to drift the discussion away from feeding ourselves, our society. Hunting and gathering is not possible anymore because to survive that way one human requires way more land than available if you divide fertile land area on this globe by 9 billion. Agriculture is the only good solution, proven by its long history, capable of optimizing yield per area. Ideally we use as little of our land as possible to produce our food, and we waste none of it by feeding animals we intend to kill or abusively exploit. That’s the benefit of veganism aside from animal cruelty. When we use as little land as necessary for agriculture, we don’t have to chop down rainforests to grow soy, not to produce meat and dairy alternatives, but to feed livestock which we then soon kill for its meat. We can have more space in the world left for nature to roam free and grow forests like it should. We can optimize cities by constructing sustainable housing that is green and full of parks and life. No concrete, which is ugly and environmentally expensive to construct. We can construct high capacity high speed suspended rail lines which eliminate the need for 6 lane highways cutting through beautiful forests.

For reference, I became Sunrise's first recruit just over 6 years ago during my junior year of high school, began getting to know people later that year who would go on to become XR leaders, became the second person ever arrested with Sunrise just over 5 years ago during my senior year of high school (the first was an early leader in the NYC hub but has more recently dropped out to focus on XR), have enjoyed participating in some of the electoral/cogovernance and inside-game legislative/lobbying/policy work (for example, I have personally known Jamaal Bowman since the summer of 2019, when he was a middle school principal and I was part of the early core group of volunteers on his campaign; a few months later I began lobbying my Sunrise hub to endorse him, leading to the massive surge of Sunrise phonebankers from all over the country that swept him into office, then I got him to speak at the picket line for my school's student worker strike a couple years ago), have been arrested 32 times thus far (7 of them at Sunrise-led actions and another 14 at actions in which Sunrise was partnering with other groups instead of taking the lead, including 12 or 13 involving XR), am as of a few months ago reluctantly my hub's actions team co-lead, have been trying to steer us closer to a movement that focuses on organizing communities to build our collective power, and have been very close with the people in XR trying to steer them toward that too. After spending our first few years focused on a strategy of as much escalating direct action, electoral and inside-game legislative work, and haphazard recruitment of more and more young people as possible, Sunrise went through a re-frontloading process for our entire movement in 2021 that seems to have been bringing us closer to a focus on real community organizing to build our collective power."", ""A lot of movements are currently working on multiracial organizing, many on multiracial cross-class organizing.

Making it easier for new members to join in,thumbfanwe,9,139nrcr,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/139nrcr/making_it_easier_for_new_members_to_join_in/,11,"Hello,

So I visited the Big One, on Saturday 22/05/23, on my own, and it was my second time attending an XR event. I had a really great time and spoke to some amazing people, but found it hard to track down any fellow loners. It was full of lots of groups and I was hesitant to approach them. And so I wanted to speak about this 😁

I attended a speech with a climate psychologist in the morning who mentioned that [74% of adults in the UK reported feeling (very or somewhat) worried about climate change](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/worriesaboutclimatechangegreatbritain/septembertooctober2022). I also spoke with a clinical psychologist who mentioned this data again. So why aren't these worriers here?

In my situation, in my local branch of friends and family, I have had nobody willing to attend an event with me. I have always felt immensely caring towards nature, yet I made decisions to act in ways that didn't involve the group.

I'm aware that it would be easy to pop along and make friends with a group of people with such amazing intentions, but perhaps we could facilitate this more? Whats the best we can do to include others at home and make new members more comfortable? How can we make it an accessible and easy process?

I had an idea of a buddy scheme, or like a shadowing session. Excuse me if this is a thing but I couldn't find anything at the event. So, maybe a tent or stall where first timers can go to buddy up with an existing XR member, or where they can meet other first timers. Or perhaps they can wear a jacket which says 'new XR member' so that everyone can welcome them (if they wish). This would have definitely encouraged me to attend an XR event earlier than I did.

I also believe that various other strategies taken from social psychology to improve group inclusivity for new members could be effective.

Thanks!",1683379881.0,9,0,,"['where are you based, local groups often have socials', 'My local group has weekly meetings. Newcomers are made very welcome and offered a buddy, as you say.\n\nIt might be easier to make better connections at a local meeting rather than a full-on international event.

Also look out for pink tables and well-being volunteers.', ""This might be shitty advice on a personal level but just don't be shy. Show up to meetings and events and ask people who to talk to if you're interested in doing something. This is a decentralized movement. We have outreach groups to help onboard people and orient them, but ultimately you kind of just have to start showing up and figuring out how you can be involved. It took me a little bit to figure that out so don't get too frustrated at first."", ""I'm in Bristol UK, I'm aware of socials here etc. I forgot to add but I mean for bigger events i think this would apply.

However, I do think for any system, if you make it easier for people to feel comfortable showing up then of course you will get more people showing up.\n\nI think it\'s so obvious that people can\'t see it, but it\'s realistic - people are shy, people want to be supported, people want to feel like they belong somewhere. And so you could just say ""Don\'t be shy!"", but if you actually want to become a bigger organisation then you need to put things in place to reach out and pull these people in. \n\nLook at how well money-grabbing organisations play on our desires, all the advertisements making it easy for us to spend our *money* on materials.

So long at the disruption is localised and temporary it can still be ignored.\n\nI think that XR generally fails to correctly distinguish between *direct action* (creating the change you want to see, legality be damned) and *action appealing to others* (i.e. protests)\n\nThe parallel is often drawn between the civil rights bus riders and XR, but I think that this is a grossly misleading comparison. \n\nThe bus riders created a catch-22 (a.k.a. double bind) situation: if the powers of the state ignore it and do nothing then the busses are de facto no longer segregated and the activists 'win', if they try to suppress it then they draw attention to the cause and trigger more people to disobey segregation, overwhelming the capacity of the state to interfere in the lives of its citizens... and the activists 'win'.\n\nThis it true of *all direct action*: if the state ignores it then the activism achieves it's goal. If we need the state to do something for us to 'win' then it's not direct action... it's protest.\n\nThis is not generally how XR operates. Since the things we do are genrally *not* directly related to the outcome we want then the state can win by simply tolerating some degree of disruption and waiting for us to run out of energy and go home. \n\nNone of us, as far as I can tell, wish to camp permanently in the royal parks or on roads... much as it's enjoyable for a while and gives a sense of camaraderie and 'doing something'. Calling it nonviolent direct action training was highly misleading.\n\nThings that I *do* think are direct action related to ecocide include:\n\n* changing what you do with your money: not giving it to ecocidal multi-national corporations and preferencing small local businesses. Not holding investments in ecocidal companies either directly through shares, or indirectly through banks or pension funds.\n\n* undermining consumerism: avoiding buying anything new (shop for second hand stuff), repairing stuff.\n\n* changing what you do with your time: not working for corporations. Noticing that most high-paying jobs pay well becuase they in some way support extractivism, ecocide and cement the power of the ruling class.\n\n* changing where you live: moving out of cities where the high cost of living generally forces you into ultimately serving the interests of the elites.\n\n* destroying the private property of extractivist corporations or otherwise imposing additional costs on them (e.g. sabotage, blockades, theft)\n\n* increasing your own and your community's capacity for self-reliance e.g. by homesteading, squatting, bin diving, sharing tools and time.\n\n* community organising / entrepreneurship: create organisations and small businesses that create useful change while simultaneously allowing fellow activists to work together and support each other rather than needing to work for ecocidal companies\n\nIn all of this it is necessary to use asymmetric warfare tactics -- as much as possible to *avoid* a situation where the corporation or state can impose a greater cost on you than you can impose on them. What we are fighting is *vastly* more powerful than we are so we need to fight efficiently.\n\nThere's nothing inherently noble about getting arrested and then having to fight a protracted legal battle, pay fines or go to jail. It *is* necessary to defy unjust laws if they stand in the way of what you're trying to do, but wherever possible maximise your effectiveness by being sneaky, anonymous and invisible.\n\nI'd love to hear more ideas for things we could do that are direct action rather than protest. Any ideas?"", 'Retraites, climat: même combat! Pas de retraités sur une planète brûlée (Pensions and climate are the same fight! No pensioners on a scorched planet)', 'nice!']"

Research bail ins.', 'The issue is that you need really massive number of people to join your cause. On the other hand disruptive civil disobedience works good enough with even small numbers and tends to rapidly expand and recruit new members. However, no matter how successful your social movement is, getting the numbers necessary to trigger a bank run will remain a fantasy. The closest thing we  have are unions calling for general strikes like it was recently in France. But unions are not social movements and are not going to help us solve climate crisis. Moreover, I\'m not sure if you\'re aware but canceling your credit card /bank account in the name of a protest is actually illegal. Even if you managed to miraculously convince enough people to join your bank run, you\'d very quickly find out where ""liberal democracy"" ends and state repression begins. The regime wouldn\'t need to arrest everyone, just make an example of a few prominent figures in the movement.', ""This would work. I'm ashamed most of the comments here are telling you the government is strong enough to withstand this.

But, as is the reason almost all protest is just “let’s go have a fun day out”, no one really does care. \n\nWe’re all either too comfortable or too stressed/ depressed to do anything that needs to be done. There’s so many things that *theoretically* would be amazing potential forms of protest but ultimately they’ll never happen. The moment existed in the 1880s through to 1930s but the left failed to take it. We were all born too late to ever achieve change. It won’t happen.', ""Well, the fed covers up to a hundred thousand (I don't know exactly how much it is in US) or so. Most people don't pass that threshold and should be safe.

And yeah you would need a alot of people but like you said start small and grow it', 'Also, how exactly do you plan to measure your growth? Is it going to be a sign up mailing list? You need to coordinate a massive number of people to withdraw money within a very short time span. If people withdrew their money at the moment they ""join"" your movement, then the withdrawals will be too spread apart and not a threat. If you set a deadline or send out an email or whatever telling people exactly when to withdraw you are making basing the plan on millions of people simply cooperating like robots. That\'s unrealistic.\nWallstreet bets has shown that its people to coordinate people on social media to cause short squeeze and manipulate stock prices. But causing a bank run is an entirely different beast. You\'re talking about much larger number of people and on top of that, in a short squeeze the is at least the opportunity for people to make money. If a bank run really happens, millions of people will lose their love savings. That\'s not very appealing. And like I said, I don\'t see any mechanism through which you could reliably measure the size of your movement. You might get millions of likes or whatever only to find out that when the time comes to actually do something and you call people to action, nothing happens.\n\nThere is a vast body of  literature and existing research on how to build social movements that put pressure on the regime. This bank run idea does not reflect how social changes were brought about historically.', ""If you'd like a realistic inspiration, the closest thing that comes to my mind are boycott. For example read about the Israeli cottage cheese boycott. But boycotts are easier that bunk runs because you don't need everyone to coordinate their actions within a small window of time. You might probably achieve more if you tried to campaign for a boycotting a specific bank for some specific reason that lots of people would agree with. But that might at best force the bank to make some small concessions. You will not force government to pass any legislation like you said in that video of yours.""]"

I\'d say only about 10% of the members here are actually a member of an ER group.

I am generally interested to know, and I'm also interested to know how many people here have read the manifesto ""Industrial Society and Its Future"" or Kaczynski's two books *Technological Slavery* and *Anti-Tech Revolution,* and where they might specifically disagree*.*",1681108018.0,3,0,,"['Please show me an example from history where a ""revolutionary movement"" ""forces"" ""the collapse"" of something\n\n*  without appalling death and misery\n* where the good guys end up in charge\n* where the stated aims of the revolution are actually achieved', 'Sorry for the essay post, didn\'t mean to make it this long but I wanted to address each of Ted\'s points, in a 35k manifesto... Yeah, apologies\n\nThe ones about brand control, social media affecting mental health and companies mishandling and buying information I can agree with (if not sympathise) but imo 100% of the problems people espouse about modern technology are 1) social media -related or 2) deforestation and general harm to the environment. The jury is still out on whether tech has harmed or helped the job market, I work in IT so I may be biased towards helped.\n\nI remember a friend summarising what Ted wrote: \n\n>he argues that technology has led to the destruction of individual freedom and the natural environment and says we should fight against tech through any means, even violent, which is why he\'s often considered one of the most prominent ecoterrorists.\n\nI mildly hate this worldview, that freedom was somehow better before technology (does he think everyone lived a worry-free, cottagecore existence back then, what about poverty and infection?) to me doesn\'t sound true, tech and modernity in general increases opportunity and welfare since it directly supports egalitarian aims like anti-discrimination job equality (it\'s more efficient to let anyone work and give everyone more opportunity) and fights against stuff like starvation (mass producer bread, irrigation tech), poverty and the opportunity costs of less fortunate countries. I also don\'t understand exactly *how* it reduces freedom, does he mean doing things the law won\'t allow, or free speech, or any number of things, still not sure but it\'s very ""back in my day""-tinted which I also dislike.\n\nI will admit, technology has made some of these things worse in a lot ways, however it\'s also provided plenty of solutions and many of the problems aren\'t with technology but the people who use it. Money laundering for example has been made super easy through credit cards, *however* it is very illegal and just one avenue of crime, if credit cards disappear they\'d just launder money through property or conflict minerals like they did in the 17th century, crime is omnipresent.\n\nThe one about tech destroying nature imo is true tho\n\nI can\'t really argue with that, *but*, tech is likely the only solution right now against it, how else are we supposed to fix all the plastic pollution or global warming right now? Technology, it\'s the solution to a problem it caused, nature will not solve plastic pollution or global warming any time soon so it\'s unrealistic to believe stopping the production of plastic worldwide (excluding the impossibility and other problems like job loss) would help, maybe in 200 years but technology could invent something a lot more instant and usable.', ""It is true, what Kaczynski advocates is unprecedented in history, but that does not mean it's impossible.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppalling misery and death--I grant you.  This would be true in the short term.  But Kaczynski's point is that if technology is allowed to continue there would be far, far more misery and death in the long term vs. if the system were to collapse now or soon.\n\nGood guys end up in charge--with the collapse to the global industrial system, the world would likely devolve into a state roughly approximating the Iron Age.  There will be good guys in charge in some places, and bad guys in charge in others, all exercising their power on a dramatically lower scale because they lack the technological means to extend their power.  And, as in the Iron Age, it will be a place where a great diversity of societies are possible, including primitive societies on the outskirts of civilized ones.\n\nStated aims of the revolution achieved--the collapse of the global industrial system would be the only achievement aspired to.

Advice re adoption as a climate activist (UK),Claire12335,43,126i7hv,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/126i7hv/advice_re_adoption_as_a_climate_activist_uk/,9,"Hello, 

This may not be the right forum to reach out to but I wasn't sure where to turn. I guess I'm hoping to find other members of the community who may have gone through this process or have knowledge on the adoption process in the UK. 

A while ago I made the decision that I would not have biological children due to the climate crisis. However, I want to be a mum more than anything, and have always been really open to the idea of adopting, even before this. This is not something I am looking to do right away, as I am still not at that point in my life where I am ready to become a parent, however I have a few concerns for the future regarding my circumstances. 

I graduated from university about a year ago now, and became involved in activism full-time, meaning that this is what I dedicate my life to. I have been arrested multiple times (for taking non-violent-direct action) and currently do not have a criminal record as I have been acquitted, but I expect my luck will eventually change. My partner is the same. 

I have done research, and it suggests that having a criminal record does not automatically prevent you from adopting (unless it is a crime against a child or a sexual crime). It would however mean of course, that we would have to disclose this information and it would be discussed. I want to be hopeful that by the time I am looking to go through this process, people will be more aware of the reality of the climate crisis, and that I will be able to explain my actions as reasonable and actions that were carried out in love in an attempt to change things to preserve some kind of habitable future and build a better world for this child. But I am so afraid that we would just be seen as extremists and automatically denied. 

As I said, I want to be a mother more than anything, and the thought of this is heartbreaking and I'm not sure what I would do. 

Has anyone involved in the climate movement or with knowledge of the adoption system experienced anything relating to this or have any advice? 

Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",1680170477.0,43,0,,"[""You said two very admirable things: that you're a dedicated climate activist and that you want to adopt.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy sister adopted a number of children, and I can tell that it requires an almost complete devotion to the children, to help them recover and to rebuild their lives - from what is usually a traumatic early life. Adoption can be literally transformative for the children (and for the parents btw).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI would imagine the concern that social services would have, is whether you and your partner would be able to be there for the children 100% when needed. And that you both were never at risk of being jailed / imprisoned.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA further point is that my sister only adopted long after she'd finished her studies and spent over a dozen years in her career.\n\nI'd say that climate activists' most crucial period, is from now and for the next 5 years or so - 'All hands on deck'. With adoption being as likely an option down the line, as it is now."", ""It is hard to say where the public attitude will be in say 10 years. You can suddenly be seen as a hero or at the least harmless.\n\nIt will probably also depend on how often it is on your record. So I would consider it a risk and try to minimise the number of arrests. Being able to play it off as a youth error will help even when attitude hasn't changed.\n\nOn the other end if attitude hasn't changed we are probably in a lot of trouble and life might be getting more about simply surviving."", ""If you want to be a mother more than anything, you have your answer.

The reality is, if we do win I think folks who were willing to be arrested will be seen as heroes.  And even if we don't win, that's likely to be true once people see things continue to get worse.  Ultimately I fear that enough children may be orphaned by the impacts of the climate crisis that adopting may look very different in a decade.  It's impossible to predict how things will go right now.  I wish you luck and thank you for your sacrifices."", ""Respectfully, people have been trying less 'drastic' methods for decades with little to no progress. Our system is so corrupt and our 'leaders' will not listen to anything that does not cause some level of disruption.

We have a responsibility to do everything we can to try and bring about the necessary change and mitigate whatever I can so that there is some kind of habitable future. \n\nSo thank you for taking the time to reply, I really do appreciate it, however ultimately it wasn't quite what I was asking. \n\nThanks again and wishing you all the best"", 'Yes of course, less drastic measures have given us nothing. I did not say half measures will *work.* I am aware of the situation. The question is, must you, specifically give up your life\'s dreams to pursue this specific action?\n\nMy perspective is different because I\'m American. Getting arrested here is dangerous and people have to be willing to risk their lives. Our police have no accountability and can literally do anything to you while you are in custody. They can ki11 you and say it was an accident and tell your family there were no cameras. I know of two instances of this directly from a cop and from a doctor. No charges, no justice. The federal government here will imprison people for years and years,  using the ""t"" word. So I think I just have a different perspective because the stakes are so high for protesting here, and I do value my own life, I don\'t feel compelled to martyrdom unless I *really* thought it would work. A man martyred himself here and the government worked with the media to obfuscate the reasons for the suicide. The media moved on.\n\nGiving up your life\'s dream is a type of martyrdom, and I think you deserve your life if it means as much as you said.', ""Well, ten percent of all people are responsible for fifty percent of all emissions. So I think it's more important to change people's attitude and behaviour than fighting overpopulation."", ""Hello, I completely agree. To me this is not about controlling population and I believe it is actually an incredibly damaging narrative, to me it is about the quality of life for that child. At this point regardless of what action we take the future for our children will look very different to what we have now, and will bring a lot of challenges. \n\nHaving this knowledge, I don't feel positive about knowingly bringing someone into this (although I want to make it clear I hold no judgement for anyone who chooses to have biological children, it is a very personal decision). However if there is already someone here, who needs a loving family, and I am able to be that and do all that I can to give them the best life possible with what we have, then I would love that.""]"

After predator animals are gone, hunters enjoy hunting wild games without competing with natural predators.\n3. Hunters choose to kill healthy and stronger animals instead of the weak. Often the leader of a pack. In nature, natural predators take down the weak ones because the healthy ones are harder to catch. This disrupts the natural cycle.\n4. After an animal dies, its carcass is valuable as they are consumed by scavengers and other organisms. Hunting disrupts that natural cycle by removing the animal from the ecosystem.', ""Why kill an individual who does not want to die when you can eat plants instead. Just because something is good for the environment does not make it moral. Thinking we are more important/greater than nature is how we got into this mess. Animals don't want to die.

Hunter-gatherers were forced to adopt agriculture partly because we wiped out so many megafauna, and chasing after smaller animals isn't that efficient. A few societies continue to hunt whales, which provide a lot of energy, but that's bad for the environment because we need whales to help store carbon (and provide other ecological services)."", ""It still sees nature and other individuals in nature as something to be used and abused by us.

But it can never be done on such a scale that it is still sustainable I'd everyone wants to eat dead animals. Only so many animals can live in a forest and if a city has 100000+ people, the forest will be empty in no time."", 'As an ecologist, I don\'t mind the theory of hunting/fishing. However, the numbers harvested should be based on the carying capacity and the vitality of the population. There might be years in which no harvesting should be allowed at all. Many highly provitable fishery industries have killed themself by overharvesting in a bad year which caused the population to crash and go to an alternative stable state with much less individuals.\n\nAditionally, hunters often have a strong lobby that leads to very dumb hunting quotas, not based on any actual ecology. In the Netherlands, deer quotas are based on ""making sure the deer dont hurt the forest"", completely ignoring the ecological principle of dynamica where forest disapears and reappears by grazing. In an other place deer and wild horse populations had been stable for 30 years, going up and down around an equilibrium. Ecologically not a system out of balance. But people forced the nature managers to start shooting them to keep populations low because a percentage used to die in winter.\n\nI am completelly in favor of hunting and eradicating invasive species when possible. Like the reindeer and rats on south georgia and domestocated cats gone wild on many islands including one in my country.\n\nThere is no way wild populations can produce enough meat btw. However, I think it is good to have a diversified food production, even if individually some of these methodes only produce a marginal amount. Lifestock is very important in the other hand, we\'d really struggle/fail completelly to produce enough plant based food without any cattle produced shit. And we really need to get writ of artificial nitrogen fertilizers as they cost enourmous amount of fosil fuels to produce.\n\nYou seem to be worried about land being cleared. Indeed, clearing land can lead to big trouble. However, indigenous people all over the world have been doing this for many generations. It doesn\'t have to be problematic. In my country there are some areas with very large arable fields that suffer greatly from wind erosion. A solution could be to reduce field size and place hedgerows in between and sow cover crops before winter. Using the right agriculture per soil type is also very important. Peat soils should never be ploughed, but can perhabs be used to grow animal folder (grass/clover or even herb rich meadows). The most important product from animal husbandery in turn is fertilizer. Milk and meat would be by products. I think we can keep eating them respectfully as indigenous people have done forever, but only on rare ocasions.\n\nThere is some nice literature on the possibilities of going organic as a planet. Most papers say we wont produce enough. However, most papers are from the global north. In the global south, harvest ussually goes up as they cant affort large amounts of pesticides and artificial fertilizer anyway and it fits better with traditional methodes. Overal, it seems likely it would not change the total food peoduction, though there is a fairly large uncertainty.', ""Thanks so far to everyone who has contributed. Every response is so informed and well measured and I am looking forward to reading and learning more from you all.\n\nI'd like to provide a little context to my question. I'm from Australia, where land clearing is immense. Introduced species run havoc and have been for many generations. The topsoil is very damaged from generations of using European agricultural practices instead of what works with the land (Dark Emu is a very interesting read on this).\n\nThere certainly are strong arguments for not eating animals, but I believe that most people will proceed to eat them anyway, hence why I imagined that perhaps encouraging game eating might be a better solution than farmed meat. Australia already culls animals with poison, bullets, cars, or exporting them live. While some is sold to other nations, much is wasted. I think if we are killing them already, we might as well be killing them in a way that allows eating rather than wasting it. \n\nI'm sure that the hunting strategy could not work everywhere. In many places, forest populations would be wiped out. But it could perhaps work here, where we have so much land and so many destructive invasive animals, and relatively few people. \n\nWhat do you all think about eating game as a strategy for somewhere like Australia?  I can foresee potential issues with the amount of pollution involved in the hunting and transporting process."", ""Well you certainly couldn't supply the same amount of meat currently consumed, but people consume too much meat.

We make things but don\'t clean up after ourselves because energy is expensive and doing it right is a liability to the bottom line.

The problem is not so much meat sourcing that\'s just a symptom of a greater systemic problems that generally boils down to if you can make your liabilities (toxic waste, air pollution, other forms of environmental damage) someone else\'s problem to pay for the consequences of that is just ""good business."" Well Boomers have been doing a LOT of ""good business"" for 50 years and climate change is the bill coming due on the later generations who will have to deal with those externalized liabilities. \n\nAs far as suggestions the full answer does not fit in a reddit post which is limited to 10k or so characters and it is a lot more than that to write up. That said I do maintain a channel on my work in green economics which I hope will help address the climate crisis. Most of the videos are 8-16 minutes but there are a couple in the 40s.

The only reason to continue the practice of taxation is to prop up the fossil fuel industry and their oligarchy. So I say we make it simple for Washington and tell them they can reduce and lower taxes by allowing the people to address the climate crisis and we take care of the rest.

Billions Will Die If They Don't Listen To Us | Aaron Bastani meets Roger Hallam | Downstream,michaelrch,25,11x8pag,ExtinctionRebellion,https://youtu.be/EvXti_b68bo,18,,1679379520.0,25,0,,"['If Roger Hallam thinks ""Oh no, billions of humans will die - what a tragedy! We need to keep alive all these people now in existence!"" then he is completely out of touch with the real, natural world.\n\nThe current human population was created by agriculture, not by Nature; the present number of our species is artificially inflated and entirely unsustainable. The human population *must* reduce if other species are to have some allowance of life on Earth.\n\nIt is no coincidence that as the human population has risen, multiple non-human populations have dropped: civilized humans are taking all the molecules available on Earth and using them to make the few things we want to eat (corn, wheat, cows, pigs, chickens, potatoes, tomatoes, apples, carrots, etc.) and to make more humans.', 'What can we do...\n\nif this is true (I think it is) then so if you\'re a kid, you\'re essentially a walking corpse.\n\nFor me, I\'m 50, I live in the USA, it\'s not so bad - I\'m likely to survive 20 years and then it\'s over for me.\n\nBut if you\'re a kid, and thus a walking corpse, what can you do?\n\nThe analysis is pretty simple.  Let\'s say you know there\'s a famine coming, and your entire family is going to die from it, and it can be avoided by stopping oil companies and industry from burning oil.  Because they\'re doing that on purpose.  They\'re purposely poisoning our air for money.\n\nWhat are you gonna do?  Anything you possibly can?  Probably.\n\nSo now you just have to figure out strategy.  Maybe call some friends, whose families are also going to die?  Maybe if you call everyone you know (count them) and they do the same thing you could get together a bunch of people.\n\nIf you did the L\'oreal thing, and you tell two friends and they tell two friends and so on, the number of people you can get motivated is:\n\n1 (you)\n\n\\+2 (you tell 2 friends)\n\n\\+4 (they tell 2 friends)\n\n\\+8 (and so on)\n\n\\+16 (and so on)\n\n\\+32\n\n\\+64\n\n\\+128\n\n\\+256\n\n\\+512\n\n\\+1024\n\nSo, if you know 2 people and they each know 2 different people and so on, you could, within 10 phone calls each, have 2,000 people show up to nonviolently shut down an oil field.\n\nWith another few phone calls you could be at 10,000.\n\nSo your whole family is going to be murdered by these oil people, and you know where the murder weapon is, and you can put together 10,000 people whose families are also going to be murdered.  Hmm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------\n\nLet me put this another way.\n\nA guy walks into your house, says ""i\'m going to murder you and your whole family, I\'m going to use this meat grinder to do it, I\'m not going to cut you up, i\'m going to grind you slowly with this machine, i have no other weapons and I can\'t physically overpower you""\n\nDo you allow him to put your fingers into the meat grinder, or do you take the meat grinder and snap it in half?', 'Oh also, it\'s not ""billions will die"" it\'s ""billions are going to be murdered and we know where the weapon is that will be used""', ""Here's another idea that doesn't involve interrupting heavily defended infrastructure.\n\nIf you're a kid and you have friends in the area, call 100 of them and get them all to quit their jobs and start one company together mowing lawns.\n\nThe lack of low-skilled labor in the immediate area will shut down oil-dependent businesses and you can still make money mowing lawns.  Use push mowers and charge low prices.  Use 1 truck for every 10 kids working.  Get your parents to let you live at home."", ""Do you have any science to back up the assertion that we cannot feed everyone sustainably, given the right diet?\n\nI have seen several major studies that show that the problem is the gargantuan wastefulness of the animal ag industry which is the problem, not how many people we have to feed.\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets\n\nHumanity is potentially sustainable. Animal-based diets aren't."", ""The temperatures are going to kill all the crops.  no wheat.  no corn. \n\nYou could eat bugs I suppose.\n\ndiet isn't the problem.\n\nburning oil is the problem."", 'I don\'t assert ""we can\'t possibly feed all these people"". Rather, I linked the decline in biodiversity to civilization\'s taking of Earth\'s finite molecules; constantly making every bit of organic matter on this planet into the few things that civilized humans want is not sustainable. And we cannot continue creating more people, we mustn\'t keep increasing the total number of our species: The biological scales are severely imbalanced already. If we want the populations of non-humans living in Nature to grow, we have to give up some of the molecules sequestered in humans and human-desired foods.\n\nI accept that some future scenario of manufacturing a nutrient-dense food square and rationing that to every human *may* *be* *possible* to sustain 15B people (something like what is posited in the science fiction movie ""Soylent Green""); but this would not be a positive for humanity, to become dependent upon factories (and distribution chains, and government oversight agencies, and bureaucrats, and harvesting & transport systems).\n\nIf one has the (bizarre) goal of maximizing the number of one species (*Homo sapiens*) living on Earth, I\'m sure technologies can increase the number of people being fed and kept alive - but they won\'t be free in any real or traditional sense, they won\'t have autonomy or be able to exercise human nature, and they won\'t have much personal space. It\'s like saying ""We can put 22 people in your bedroom, if we stack coffins for them to sleep and work in, and everyone uses a diaper and catheter."" Sure, maybe we could do that, but why?!?\n\nWhen you state, as do many others, that ""Animal-based diets aren\'t"" sustainable, I suspect you are disregarding the numerous human societies where people hunted and foraged and lived in this way forever, preying upon animals but not polluting their local environs or pushing the biosphere to the precipice of collapse. The salmon didn\'t start going extinct until the concrete dams stopped their spawning migrations and the trawlers started harvesting them *en masse* and their food supplies started dwindling; the hunting of buffalo (or monkeys, or tapirs) did not produce dust storms and groundwater pollution and soil erosion and antibiotic resistance and algae blooms and imperil the future the way that cow or pig or chicken farming does today. So it seems to me that the problem is not at all the animal-based diet of humans as it is the technological agricultural system which is the foundation for civilization.', ""There is no point looking to Bronze Age man for sustainably tips. Population density then was a small fraction of what it is today. \n\nRead the link I posted. There simply isn't enough land to farm animals sustainably at this level of population. Don't try to Intuit this stuff. Your gut doesn't understand ecosystem science and the numbers around relative land and water use for various types of food production. That's what scientific analysis is for.\n\nAlso not sure why you think I want to maximise population. I certainly don't. But I also don't want to somehow drive depopulation against the will of human beings who have human rights to things like having children. And as I say, it's unnecessary to impose such authoritarian measures."", 'I didn\'t assume *you* specifically want to maximize the human population, but some people seem to; I don\'t know what else underlies all these notions and claims that ""we can, *potentially*, theoretically - under ideal conditions imagined on paper, and if executed as planned, with no unexpected problems - feed 15B people forever"". To do so would not something good, nor is that what we should strive for. Certainly such suggestions *imply* that getting the human population up to 15B is fine, with no problem - a position which does not square with biological reality, unless one is willing to eradicate everything not in use for civilized living.\n\nIf you see much of my commentaries, you\'ll certainly see me defend the human animal\'s natural ability (inclination) to procreate without infringements imposed; I never suggest a genocide or prevention of parenthood, only the end of centralized food creation and worldwide food distribution, the two main drivers of the incessant human population increase. Stopping humanity from overflowing the bounds of Nature also requires the end of the techno-medical system and the sanitation systems required to keep dense populations from becoming septic. But I don\'t see returning to Nature as anything remotely close to ""authoritarian measures"". And that would be paleolithic Man, not Bronze Age. (Why should the lower population of that era not be a beacon of what to strive for? Your comment is like saying, ""We can\'t look to when the house wasn\'t on fire for how to live, our house is on fire now."")\n\nSpeaking of ""authoritarian measures"", how do you imagine that the current 8B (or whatever it rises to) humans will be fed sustainably? How else but by ""authoritarian measures"" and centralized management, worldwide oversight by a few, with technological powers, will it be ensured that ""the right diet"" will be developed and dispersed to ""feed everyone sustainably""? What is the non-authoritarian model for deciding what diet should be offered (imposed) for everyone? Shall it be soya, crickets, wheat gluten? Some populations can sustain themselves upon hunting animals; I can\'t see how this could be allowed while giving people in other places rations of manufactured sustenance bars... is that not authoritarian, or acceptably authoritarian?\n\nHow far from Nature will we humans need to be removed to be able to feed an unnatural, enormous human population, before you will decide it\'s not worthwhile? Without the goal of maximizing human numbers across Earth, why work with all these programs and technological enhancements to ensure that the human population stays so elevated beyond what Nature can sustain?', ""If you want to drastically change diets in most countries, don't have to do anything authoritarian. Just stop subsidising animal ag, properly regulate its pollution, deceptive advertising and environmental destruction, and subsidise plant-ag instead. \n\nMost animal ag doesn't make a worthwhile profit without subsidies. In the U.K. for example, 90% of profits in the animal ag industry are the subsidies. This is about 25% in plant-ag.\n\nAnd that's before you internalise the costs of the destruction animal ag causes through its health and environmental impacts.\n\nNote, I am not actually arguing for only market mechanisms to fix this problem, but they alone would dramatically scale back animal ag as it became far too expensive for most people. But note this doesn't have to punish the poor if you switch the subsidies to healthy plant-based foods. In fact it would benefit them by providing healthier food at lower prices.\n\nMeanwhile a campaign to actually wreck the global food system as you seem to propose would cause the starvation of millions of people, mostly in the poorest countries who rely on imported grain to survive."", '>Meanwhile a campaign to actually wreck the global food system as you seem to propose would cause the starvation of millions of people\n\nYou keep giving signs that you don\'t process anything I write. My whole point in the first place was that there are too many individuals of the human species, and that reducing our inflated population is *essential*, and not the problem Roger Hallam seems to think it.\n\n**With the end of the technological system, many humans *will* die. On the other hand, with the *continuation* of the technological system, every organic, evolved lifeform on Earth will (at the least) be altered and conformed to serve technology\'s advancement, if not eradicated outright.**\n\nThis nonsense about ""we can feed everyone"" is so ridiculously short-sighted.\n\nSupposing you feed 15B people, where do they all live, stacked up in a filthy bustling megalopolis, totally removed from the habitat humans are evolved with and adapted to? Where do they all get water from, some magical places where it is now just sitting idle, unused by other lifeforms? Where do we put all the feces generated by these unfathomable masses of people? You can\'t just forever flush it away (and forget about Earth having to reabsorb it), like it is no big deal, out of sight and forgotten.\n\nImagine someone living in the penthouse expanding upward by taking bricks from the first floor of the building, and when you say ""We can\'t keep expanding the building up"" he says ""We have plenty of bricks down below, we can build up several hundred metres if we don\'t need to have solid walls at bottom."" But the bricks don\'t merely serve for *obstructing vision* into a residential unit, they serve to stabilize the base of the whole structure...\n\n>Most animal ag doesn\'t make a worthwhile profit without subsidies.\n\nProfitiability is irrelevant to how the human animal conducts itself and survives.\n\nDo you not know that all agriculture is subsidized by govt? Do you think that veg farming is profitable without subsidies, and is profitability your concern? Do you need to be explained how ecologically awful is rice farming, or palm oil creation, or plantations growing apples or carrots or wheat?\n\nWhat is the ecological impact of creating factories to convert plants into unnatural forms now in demand (e.g., burgers, sausages, meatballs, etc.)? Surely you would not want to allow these plant-based environmental problems to persist - or would you?\n\nIf you want to talk about markets and economics behind the food industry, you should understand that if 95% of suppliers leave the market then the 5% who remain will make plenty of money supplying what is in demand (whether that is heroin or beef). Eliminating subsidy to chicken farmers will perhaps bring about the closure of most chicken-creating operations, but those who remain can profit by raising prices and supplying the demand for chicken (and beef, and pork, and rabbit, and horse), even at higher prices.\n\nThere aren\'t many duck meat suppliers, but enough to serve the demand for duck meat; on the other hand, there are no farms of bear meat, because there is no demand. Even without govt subsidy to farms, the demand for meats will exist, and some suppliers will meet the demand even if only at high prices affordable to a few. Most of your argument rationale is fantastical and not grounded in reality.', "">My whole point in the first place was that there are too many individuals of the human species, and that reducing our inflated population is essential, and not the problem Roger Hallam seems to think it.\n\nIt's not a population problem, it's a consumption problem. If it was a population problem then India would have a larger carbon footprint than Europe, whereas the opposite is the case.\n\nAs for having fewer people being a good thing, sure it makes it easier to reduce overconsumption of Earth's resources, but not all methods of degrowth of population are equal. The reason why it matters how population degrowth happens is because some ways have massive negative consequences. For example, if we want to see an equitable world then democracy needs to be strengthened, but if we see the break down of society due to wars over resources it's pretty obvious that democracy will be replaced by dictatorships. Perhaps you're willing to live under a dictatorship fighting over remaining resources in order to see population degrowth, but that's not the only option available to us, much better options exist now.\n\nWhat is more important to look at is what keeps consumption of the earth's resources high, and the answer is capitalism. Capitalism masks the damage we're causing to our home planet and encourages further consumption. Climate change is a symptom of capitalism, replacing that with an economic model more in line with the life cycles of the planet is far more important than having less people, and will naturally restrict population growth as a consequence."", '>what keeps consumption of the earth\'s resources high, and the answer is capitalism.\n\nN.Korea has a very low foootprint; is that the non-capitalist model for consumption levels? Most anti-capitalist Leftists I\'ve spoken with want N.Koreans (and Chinese, and Cubans, and everyone) to get *more* material goods, not fewer, and these anti-capitalist Lefties (in the Western liberal democracies) don\'t want to *reduce* the level of material goods available for themselves, they simply want a few billionaires not to be profiting so greatly from industrial production.\n\nHumanity doesn\'t actually need toilets or hospitals or lightbulbs or Internet or high-speed trains or autonomous vehicles; humanity needs wild Nature.\n\n>If it was a population problem then India would have a larger carbon footprint than Europe, whereas the opposite is the case.\n\nWhich society requires more total calories to be fed, a society with >1B people or one with 68M people? Which mass of humans consumes more water and produces more fæces, a society with 68M humans or a society with 15× that amount? And have impoverished Indians decided they are satisfied with their present low-footprint ""standard of living"", that they do not want to increase their level of comforts and luxuries to what Americans and Europeans know? Or are they pursuing to consume more than they do presently, while being magnitudes greater in number? Won\'t that be an ecological problem, if the 1B civilized Indians ""succeed"" in ""rising from proverty"" to ""live better"" as do overconsuming Westerners?\n\nThe natural counterbalance to population rise in every species is starvation: when food flourishes, those who eat it grow in number, until they eat so much that the food is diminished and their number dwindles. (Then the food may also grow abundant again.) Agriculture has removed humanity from this cycle, so that when our number rises we *create* more food - thus never diminishing our population, while also depriving non-humans of foods *and living space*, constantly turning into *more human beings* those molecules which could otherwise have become non-human creatures.\n\nDemocracy isn\'t worth much, even if practiced as idealized. People will vote to get a free First Class international flight every year, regardless of the financial or ecological cost - popular support doesn\'t mean it should be done. And can you imagine Britons (or others) *voting* to reduce their electricity and food supplies, and drastically lessen the UK\'s techno-industrial and financial activity, so as to not further damage Nature? Of course not; techno-industrial civilization *cannot* be aligned with Nature, and it will not be ended *voluntarily* by widespread agreement and votes from those sustained by technological society.\n\nThe technological system must be fully vanquished, because if Technology is allowed to continue, the natural world will be completely ravaged beyond any ability to sustain the long-evolved more complex lifeforms.', 'Regarding North Korea, I stated ""an economic model more in line with the life cycles of the planet"". Does North Korea\'s economic model fit that description? No. Therefore, it\'s a bad example. There are more economic models than just capitalism and communism, and living in line with the life cycles of the planet is not just about consuming less. If you want better examples of what I meant, look into doughnut economics and other similar circular economy models.\n\nRegarding your questions about how to feed humans on a planet that also needs to go through rewilding, read Regenesis by George Monbiot, he lays out a path forward on this. Basically it boils down to changing our diets and relying on novel food technologies like precision fermentation. This also addresses your point about technology being bad if left to continue, as technologies like precision fermentation can both reduce our carbon footprint and increase the potential scope for rewilding projects far more than if we went back to reliance on preindustrial technology. In other words, it\'s too simplistic to state that the evolution of technology in itself is a problem.\n\nRegarding democracy not being worth much, it sounds like you\'re speaking in favour of dictatorships, which is all fine and dandy if you get to be the dictator, but not so much if you\'re a citizen living in one. Democracies aren\'t perfect, they\'re just the least bad model of equitable decision making we have. Also, we can strengthen our democracies beyond what we have now, in ways that reduce corruption and promote greater education of the electorate.', '>it sounds like you\'re speaking in favour of dictatorships\n\nThere are more ways of living as an animal on Earth beyond being ruled by ""Democracy"" or suffering a dictatorship.\n\nGeorge Monbiot is a dogmatic vegan peddling techno-hopium; the man *loves* to talk or write about technologies saving us in one way or another, and when the right technological salvation comes along, *then* we can eat our cake and have it, too: we\'ll feed (and house) everyone worldwide because Technology will handle all the problems. If you swap ""tech"" for ""the wizard"" you can easily see how silly are *all* of his proposals. ""We can make vegan food in space, from hydrogen and electricity, and feed 10B people!"" It\'s amazing that he still holds any respect, his works are *constantly* presenting some new techno possibility and hailing it until something else presents, to distract from the fact that last year\'s dreamy techno-fix didn\'t work and never came to be. Monbiot needs to be ignored, he is just putting up nonsense and fantastical distractions for his own fame.\n\nIf ""precision fermentation"" worked out to feed 8B+ humans, those controlling the program (and the distribution of its yields) would be practically gods, the most powerful people to ever exist. If they are fully benevolent, they are not infallible, and one mistake would mean a lot of starvation. Anyone with a power to impede production or distribution would be able to make the global human population kneel. Like Monbiot\'s prior proposals, it is an awful, horrible suggestion and clearly hasn\'t been given ten minutes of critical thought.\n\nOne problem with Technology is that it affords to the short-sighted and imperfect human far more power than he has naturally, and a human using such powers - even not malevolently, and with consideration - cannot know all the consequences which will result from the enormous power to alter the world as provided by modern technologies.\n\nBefore becoming technological beings, humans were animals, and we lived just fine. A bad decision by someone in what is now China did not starve someone in what is now Argentina, nor did a person in a faraway land surveil and control people around the world. Technology\'s advance has stripped us of Nature and innate human freedom: even Stalin didn\'t have the power to track everyone and abduct or neutralize opponents anywhere, which every technological nation can employ today. Prof. Noah Yuval Hariri has written about how Technology is more empowering to authoritarianism than it is empowering and revitalizing Democracy.\n\nTechnology pursues efficiency, and inefficiency is one of the major setbacks faced by dictatorships; with new technological powers, dictatorships can outcompete democracies, and then what happens? If some method works, it is copied by others...\n\nTo the extent that any technological development has allowed us to avoid Nature\'s boundaries, it is a bad thing, although it may take a while for the repercussions to arrive: the Green Revolution increase of global agricultural yields (via fertilizers and pesticides) is one example, where it seemed to be no problem to increase harvests and feed more people - except that it provides us *more* people, which means all the Earthly life which isn\'t people has less space and food to live upon, and averting starvation of many civilized humans has meant thr eradication of ""biodiversity"" (all those evolved lifeforms not desired within civilization).\n\nYou are welcome to think that we can ""have it all"" and sacrifice nothing from current material ""standard of living"", but wishing and hoping doesn\'t make it reality or even possible. If you want to see biodiversity rise, they need to have living space and foods different from what civilized people are willing to allow. We have to give up much of what we have taken. N.Korea is one example of a society where people have few manufactured goods and make little ""carbon footprint"", but as soon as you boost The Economy there, the society will be flooded with crap. \n\nI don\'t like N.Korea as it is an overwatched and controlled society where people have been conformed to serve the machine. And certainly as it gains more technological powers, it becomes more difficult for people to regain their freedom. But for most of human history we had little impact on Earth\'s survival, and were free, roaming fields and climbing mountains and generally living with Nature.\n\nIf you want to save Nature, you don\'t - *can\'t* - do it by continuing the technological society which has brought us multiple ecological crises in the blink of an eye (compared to the 200M years of human existence). You have to decide if your priority is get democracy, veganism, and flashy cool gadgets and gizmos delivered by the ruling class, or to have real freedom and the age-old human experience of living with Nature, which we evolved to do.', 'and the musicians argued while the titanic sank.  useless liberals.', 'You\'re making a fool of yourself with talk of North Korea and ""You are welcome to think that we can ""have it all"""".

It certainly seems easier to be vegan to people who a leaset are than it does to those who aren\'t. So there is a bit of talking past eachother there.\n\nIt\'s also probably a bit because vegans are in this state of awareness about the cruelty of animal ag which most people aren\'t and so that drives an emotional engagement which can often be unhelpful. Sometimes emotional engagement in a discussion can help, but it is often counterproductive when it triggers people\'s cognitive dissonance, and also potentially some defensiveness as most people are resistant to change (or being challenged to change).\n\nThe best approach is probably just to give people incremental encouragement and practical advice.

Classical music today like almost any other expensive art is still largely funded by rich people though in many cases since the second half of the last century the music has multiple elements from many disparate carefully studied cultures put toghether in new ways such as with the music of Unsuk Chin. **The art scene is arguably a very strange platform of diplomacy** that I barely understand. 

In the past **Beethoven's 9th** was used and abused by every significant yet mutually incompatible ideologies as some form of high ideal. People argue that the piece *is* an **ideology**. I was wondering which piece of the western canon best represents **our time in history**. In the odd case ExtintionRebelion was to **organize a concert or simply suggest some inspiring pieces** of complex music to explore and write about which would be No.1?. 

I think it would be [**Edgar Varèse's Amériques**](https://youtu.be/Upo5FStElCc). A very strange iconic unique work for very large orchestra that constantly shifts between moments of **quiet folkloristic contemplation and giant masses of chaotic dissonant textures.** It's like today when we are **finally listening** to what the remaining descendant of all the **genocides of capitalism** have to say but at the same time we have to **confront the fact that we are right at the door of total chaos** with no guarantee a new period of stability is even possible and **the whole discourse is happening in a complexly interwoven global context with multiple juxtaposing paths.** 

I do realise this whole message may sound like an excercise in intellectual masturbation over art very few people listen anyway and maybe it is but: 

1) **There actually is a whole diverse community of open young people** **familiar with it** (just visit the classical music subreddit and discords) 

**2) people still regard this type of art as a ""serious medium"" and maybe there is a chance of entering that level of conversation** and I think wouldn't be that hard to just try.

Anyway, I'm from Uruguay where contemporary music is played like twice a year at best so the short term local effects of this idea would be negligible for me but **if you live in the UK where massive world class widely broadcasted orchestras a thing the considerations change.**

Its passing would mark the latest in a series of assaults against the democratic and human rights of public and peaceful assembly. With the Bill's readoption of many of the same measures thrown out last year by the Lords' review of the[ Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/32/contents), it is clear that there is a British legislative agenda that is unrelenting in its mission to associate activism with criminality.

Read the article on our [website](https://www.cause.cx/post/activists-are-criminals-introducing-the-legislation-designed-to-undermine-our-rights), and join the growing activist movement, [here](https://www.cause.cx/).

These developments sit as a Governmental response to the growing discontentment with their handling of the cost of living crisis. Proposed strike action will now bring the UK to the edge of a[ *de facto* general strike](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11648793/Rishi-Sunak-demands-Labours-Keir-Starmer-backs-anti-strike-laws-ahead-looming-general-strike.html). While public support for collective action[ holds strong](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/14/most-uk-voters-still-back-strikes-by-nurses-and-ambulance-crews), ten days ago Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed new anti-strike legislation, which seeks to diminish the power of trade unions and degrade the confidence of members to engage in direct action. The[ Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3396) joins the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and proposed Public Order Bill as the latest move in an apparently coordinated strategy by the current Government to undermine the right to peaceful assembly as a whole and degrade public confidence in and perception over the right to protest.

# Rights Under Attack

A cost of living crisis emerged in early 2022 as the disparity between historical wage growth and inflation rates grew. The crisis has motivated unions, across the UK, to mobilise their members for collective action. Yet action over the crisis is not limited to the work of unions; climate justice, anti-discrimination and other political and social pressure groups have connected the cost of living crisis to[ deeper institutional problems](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/05/thousands-expected-attend-london-rally-demand-general-election-peoples-assembly-cost-living-crisis).

&#x200B;

[Unions are rallying their members to strike \(Nick Efford\)](https://preview.redd.it/4pgob2w8vmda1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ff01d8cf1acea45902cf09513c1e78f6fd0310b)

There is a swelling of activity around the cost of living crisis, and the inaction of Government to respond to union demands for fairer pay. Unionised strike action is instead set within a legislative agenda that challenges the very heart of their power: the legal mechanisms that allow unions to engage in collective action and protect their members from undue judicial pressure. These challenges are not just an affront to a just system of democratic checks and balances, but more broadly serves to destabilise the entire character of democratic, activist rights in the UK.

The recently-proposed Anti-Strikes Bill seeks to undermine unions' ability to organise and mobilise their members for collective action. The Bill, if passed, would allow Ministers to write *ad hoc* regulations to force some workers to ignore strike actions, cross picket lines and turn up to work. It would be within the rights of employers to sack employees that do not comply with these regulations, and unions themselves could face huge fines if their members do not comply with Government demands.

The Bill is intended to divide unions, and attack the confidence of workers in their ability to demand change. By threatening unions with huge fines for the actions of members, the Bill's measures intend to disincentive union leaders to even suggest strike action to their members. But, perhaps more concerning, the Bill proposes to undermine the confidence of *all* trade union members by applying monumental legal scrutiny to individual workers. The Bill undermines the essential character of the[ human right to peaceful assembly](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights): that individuals are afforded a basic legal protection to engage in collective action. Those in power must deal with popular movements by addressing their collective demands, not by using the organs of State to apply pressure to individuals themselves. By applying legal pressure to individuals, workers are brought out of wider movements and into positions of exposed public scrutiny: suddenly, union members are forced to decide whether to preserve their jobs and livelihoods or defend the unity of their movements. Change cannot come at the ransom of lost livelihood.

# Activists Are Criminals

The Anti-Strikes Bill fits within a larger legislative strategy that seeks to associate activism with criminality. A programme of legislation is being carefully pushed through Parliament, and it seeks to turn activism over into the grey areas of legality and cast activists into the fringes of society. The 'Policing Act', now enshrined in law, has laid the foundations for the increasingly 'grey' area of law activism now inhabits.

Despite criticism from[ three former Prime Ministers, over seven hundred academics, and three hundred and fifty charities](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/issue/the-policing-bill-what-happened-and-what-now/), the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act was eventually passed into law late last year. The law gives the police the power to shut down protests deemed too disruptive. Among other definitions of disruption, a protest can now become illegal if it is judged by the[ police to be too noisy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0052022-police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-act-2022/circular-0052022-police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-act-2022).

The Act received criticism from many organisations for placing restrictions and parameters on the right to freedom of assembly. A[ briefing published by a large coalition of charities and NGOs](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Joint-Briefing-on-Pt.-3-PCSCB-Ping-Pong-February-2022a.pdf) highlighted that ""noise stands at the heart of protest. Making noise is how we, quite literally, make our voices heard by those in power"".

Many of the more draconian measures, originally thrown out of the Policing Act as it passed through Parliament, have now made a resurgence in the proposed Public Order Bill. Following months of protests, the Bill's stated aim is to minimise public disruption. But much of the Bill focuses on criminalising individual acts of protest: locking on and gluing, in particular.

&#x200B;

[The House of Lords threw out some of the Policing Bill's more draconian measures](https://preview.redd.it/ruz4p6wavmda1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3bf3d09048b2a25a57a69c67ccd93664e1494a4)

Whether the Public Order and Anti-Strike Bills are passed, long-term and significant harm has already been dealt to our right to assemble and call for change. It is not immediately a legal harm, although this will surely follow. Instead, it is a harm to confidence and perception.

A powerful anti-activist narrative is already in development: it is not a legal narrative, but an emotive one. Activists are criminals. By associating activism with criminality in proposed legislation, the focus of political discussion is – whether passed or not – is firmly fixed on a harmful association of activism with criminality. This association serves to degenerate activism and activists, and to draw people away from direct action in general.

The political machine's discussion of activism serves to confuse and obfuscate citizens' relationship to the right to protest. Suddenly, we are all forced to consider whether the peaceful protest we might attend is even legal? Or whether the volume of my chanting could result in a criminal record?

This legislative agenda chips away at not just the right to protest, but the source from which the power of direct action is derived: confident, passionate, engaged participants. By pursuing a narrative that seeks to cast activists as criminals, this legislative agenda seeks to undermine the very source of people-power: confidence.

Rather than just say I\'m mistaken, why don\'t you lay out what are the alternatives to disabling modern society or continuing it?

Go on, let\'s hear it.\n\n4. Back to a question posed previously, which you avoided, with slightly different focus: What is the consequence of keeping alive 8B people? You don\'t want people to die? So what is the social and ecological toll? Prove how smart you are, think this through and explain to us how 8B people are forever fed and housed, and what happens when they exercise their human nature to have kids. I\'m expecting something like, ""We actually have enough food to feed 10B people, we just need efficient distribution. And birth rates are dropping in developed nations."" If that\'s your response, don\'t bother, I can\'t presently bear to once again break down how flawed is such utter nonsense.\n\n4. If you believe that ""life-saving medicine"" is an essential, please explain how it is that humanity survived before hospitals of the late 1800s, or medicines of the early 1900s (but more practically, medicines of the late 1900s). What natural ailments are medicines saving people from? How many ""life-saving medicines"" are not counteracting problems caused by industrial society?\n\n5. Right now the scale is weighed fully toward civilized humanity, with the non-human world on the other plate. You want to keep everyone, so please tell us how you imagine balancing that scale by increasing the non-human world without reducing any of the load on the weighted side.', 'Isn\'t having children what every animal does? So it should not be seen as a *positive* result of technological society\'s influence upon the human animal.\n\nAnd those changes within the ""developed world"" are not impacting the world total. Birth rates in the W.E.I.R.D. nations have been declining for a while, but has the global population ever decreased since the undertaking of agriculture? (No.)\n\nPeople didn\'t face extinction before agriculture supplied constant calories to humanity, in fact we were far healthier as forager-hunter animals in small communities. The consequence of supplying people worldwide with calories is the constant increase in human numbers, which comes unavoidably at the expense of non-human flora and fauna populations. Without agriculture and global transport, humanity will be fine, and non-humans will be allowed to recover from the edge of extinction.', '1) common definition of ecofascism is a government that militantly enforces environmental measures over the needs and freedoms of its citizens. Idk where you got your definition.\n\n2) The villager has more freedom from tyranny but they are not more free. Freedom is multifaceted, and freedom from tyranny is only one aspect. The villager would die if born premature. They would die if they got a significant infection. It’s good that we can now save a persons life if they have a heart attack. I don’t want to throw that away.\n\n3) Nah I would of course nationalize all industry, radically reduce production and focus it on important goods, medicine, clothing, the like. Convert food production to staples, ideally using permaculture techniques honed to the area. Get help from Cuba in this area, they’re doing very good permaculture farming, but they only know like their area so gotta figure out experts in each different area. Probably ban fishing, though that might be tough, but we’ve fucked up the ocean so much. It’s important to get buy in from the people so I think you have to help them directly as well, most importantly to me would be by repairing homes, and granting power, phone, and internet access. This does require some power, but much less than is currently being used. \n\n4) ecological impacts of overpopulation are a myth. Environmental footprint is extremely divergent across the population. There are many people in the world today that make a carbon footprint that is entirely irrelevant to climate change. There are no consequences to climate change if there are 8billion of those people or 10b or 15b.\n\n4b) They didn’t a ton of people fucking died.\n\n5) I’m not gonna justify how I exactly balance the scale. That’s your value judgment that has nothing to do with me.', ""The global population _has_ fallen since the advent of agriculture- off the top of my head, during the Bronze Age Collapse, Black Death and during the colonisation of the Americas. There are dozens of other examples- agriculture doesn't necessarily make societies more stable (and in fact makes them particularly vulnerable to things like crop failures and breakdown of agricultural economy due to things like epidemics, emigration or warfare) but the bigger populations that result can lead to death and destruction on a scale previously unthinkable. \n\nI agree with the rest of your comment though, the current structure of our society is an anomaly."", ' Tell me you\'re 14 without telling me you\'re fourteen.\n\nBy your own definition, which is not substantially divergent from what I put, you never should have put ecofascism anywhere near me.

so it's been a while, since I was actually at an XR event, but what really irritated me, the last time was the scope of the change the activists wanted to achieve.

It was not strictly about climate or even environmental issues, but about a much wider range of subjects, starting from womens right so lgbtq rights, racissm, right down to a critique of capitalism, critique of imperialism, our relationship to the global south etc etc.

I don't mean to minimize all of these issues. They sure are important, but to me it seems like the activists I met were trying to solve all of the world's problems at once. I am scared that this mission creep will eventually lead to a complete failure of the whole movement.

&#x200B;

Also, if you believe that achieving all of these diverse social justice goals is necessary to fight climate change, I think fighting climate change directly is still a better way to get there. Let me put it that way: If you believe as an example, that it is necessary to end capitalism, in order to stop climate change, then you should still fight climate change, and not capitalism. Because capitalism is an abstract concept that many people cling to and are prepared to die for. Climate change is something that you can fight directly, by blocking acess to fossil fuel extraction sites, destroying equipment for fossil fuel consumption etc etc.

If you, without adressing any issues related to capitalism, suceed in stopping climate change, you will also automatically have destroyed capitalism, since if capitalism were still the dominant economic system, climate change would not be stopped. That is if you really believe in the incompatibility of sustainable politics and climate change. If, countrary to your beliefs sustainability would still be compativble with capitalism, hey, at least we will live to fight another day. Maybe capitalism will be next on the list. Or racism. Or whatever. But our first priority should be to survive, so we can fight another day.

It's unfortunate, but the solution can't be simple. \n\nAlso, another consideration. We're trying to undergo arguably the biggest purposeful transformation of society in human history.

I suggest that is not even induced climate change, because solving for that with technologies will still leave us eradicating biodiversity, and physically and mentally damaged by being disconnected from our evolved ways as human animals. Furthermore, being dependent upon more technologies will further erode our natural freedom, making us conform further to the ways required for smooth operation of the global technological machine-society. Climate change has been caused by technology, and it is but one nasty head of the Hydra.\n\nIf you have a serious desire to save Nature, I addressed some strategic flaws of \'climate activism\' in this article, [Effective Action in Time of Crisis](https://jorgecluni.medium.com/please-just-stop-just-stop-oil-when-revolution-is-needed-reform-efforts-are-worse-than-nothing-2cff85a5f5f0).', '[deleted]', ""The amount of problems in this country and in the world that need fixing are so varied, interconnected and spread that finding core problems to fix is smart but more challenging to achieve. The movement itself, for a lot of us, can be about finding how you personally can best be able to fix some of the problems we face, either independantly or with a team. \n\nI like to imagine our country as a tree with each county being a branch. If you're going round fixing broken or poisoned leaves then you're helping the casulties of this system, fixing people, communties and economies. If you're in the ground caring and better adapting the roots to the ground (the reality) it holds itself in then you're changing our laws, our rights, our regulations and rules, maybe even our morality. And if you're fixing the bark and the trunk of the tree; how it looks, holds itself and connects to itself then you're changing the architecture, the infrastructure, image and identity of our tree. \n\nSo being as invovled as you are capable of being, being awake and informed as you can possibly be, and focussing your energy in the right places to get yourself in a place to fix any of the problems we face, is what each of us must do to fight for the change we need."", 'There’s a lot of people who can only grapple with the “what” of climate change and never the “why” with the “what” being things like how many cars there are and their fuel source or how much heating we need for our houses. That’s something that can be solved in technical ways if the will is there (and even then the will is not always there). This question if “what” or “how” is often employed to muddy the waters with regards to the “why” though.\n\nSo let’s take an example: a lot of people find public transport unreliable and so they’re hoping to get an electric car or an airplane that doesn’t pollute (even though air travel is basically public transport, only it’s privatized) - in other words they’re looking for a tech solution but the view fails to consider if there’s other reasons public transit fails them like lack of political focus or funding. Identifying more ways to combat our emissions gives us a better chance at finding solutions but a lot of these solutions end up brushing up against other aspects of our society like our willingness to live close to people who are not like us or to accept that public transit might only solve 80% of our needs and so we have to borrow or rent a car for the rest (which a lot of people in cities do now anyways).', 'Extremists will always seek to infiltrate themselves in any cause with broad support to hyjack the scope.

First proposed over a year and a half ago, the legislation for improving online safety has been mired in controversy over its implications for censorship and free speech. While the [concerns over censorship](https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2022/11/the-online-safety-bill-will-fundamentally-undermine-rights-to-freedom-of-expression/) raised by figures across the political spectrum are undoubtedly worthy of debate (and, in my opinion, very valid), I am more concerned about the ramifications of the bill for encryption and privacy. Unfortunately, this well-intentioned bill is in its current state a disaster of rights, entirely negligent of its consequences for the security and privacy of the very people it is intended to protect.

This article is taken from a recent blog update from CAUSE: the encrypted social network for activists. Learn more at: [https://www.cause.cx/](https://www.cause.cx/)

# A Brief History of the Online Safety Bill

The Bill in question certainly arises out of a genuine and pressing need. The internet as it stands today is in the grip of a handful of social media giants with little to no concern over the safety and security of their users. The content recommendation algorithms of Facebook, Youtube and the like are known to [routinely promote hateful or dangerous content](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581) to adults and children alike, carelessly proliferating fraud, conspiracy theories, and neo-fascist bilge to an impressionable audience. To see this in action, we need look no further than the (thankfully recently arrested) self-described misogynist Andrew Tate, whose rapid rise to TikTok fame has led his violently hateful views to be [heard from schoolboys](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-64234568) across the country, almost overnight.

This situation is not helped, of course, by the apathy and disregard of the leadership of these megacorporations. For example, Elon Musk’s recent takeover of Twitter has been characterised by a floundering lack of understanding of the nuances of free speech, a haphazard [removal and reinstatement of suicide prevention features](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/24/twitter-restores-suicide-prevention-feature), and most notably a chaotic attempt to monetise verification. That particular episode of Musk’s seeming attempt to lose as much money as quickly as possible allowed twitter users to purchase “verified” status for only $8 USD per month, and the outcome was obvious: rife [misinformation and identity fraud](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/11/12/fake-eli-lilly-twitter-account-claims-insulin-is-free-stock-falls-43/?sh=10f5f07f41a3) within hours of the feature being introduced.

With this context, it is clear to see why Sunak’s Conservatives are so keen to introduce into law a piece of legislation which might hold these too-powerful social media companies to account over their failures to protect their users. The Online Safety Bill, viewed generously, strives to achieve just that, empowering Ofcom to take action against websites who fail to protect users, particularly children, from harmful content.

# Privacy and Surveillance

Despite the timely nature and good intentions of the Online Safety Bill, it suffers from a vital flaw which exposes the public to invasions of privacy, cybercrime, and mass surveillance. In particular, the Bill requires that online platforms may be ordered by the government to “use accredited technology to identify CSEA content, whether communicated publicly or privately by means of the service, and to swiftly take down that content.” In other words, the bill mandates that social media companies be able to automatically scan private messages to attempt to identify child sexual abuse material.

The consequences of this cannot be overstated. To achieve this at a technical level, companies such as WhatsApp which provide end-to-end encryption in their messages must build backdoors into their software allowing users to be spied on at any time, and their messages to be decrypted without permission from either sender or recipient. This is such a severe erosion of the fundamental principle of end-to-end encryption that WhatsApp has [threatened to block the United Kingdom](https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/whatsapp-encryption-uk-online-safety-bill-b1046586.html) from using the service - a privilege up until now only extended to China, Syria, and Qatar. For the UK to find itself in the company of such, ahem, bastions of human rights is shocking, but hardly surprising given the [track record](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-factsheets/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-protest-powers-factsheet) of this government when it comes to protecting freedom of expression.

Indeed, the requirement that such platforms automatically scan private messages, despite the benevolent intention, means that users of previously secure messaging applications can expect their messages to be read and scanned without any suspicion of wrongdoing; we are therefore forced now to put our trust in the very companies who have so shamelessly ignored the safety of their users to handle our private messages in a secure and benevolent way. The proposed scanning technologies are such a threat to privacy and free expression that 70 organisations, cybersecurity experts, and elected officials published a scathing [open letter](https://www.globalencryption.org/2022/11/70-organizations-cyber-security-experts-and-elected-officials-sign-open-letter-expressing-dangers-of-the-uks-online-safety-bill/) directed to PM Sunak highlighting the ways the proposed Bill will undermine human rights and place vulnerable members of society at risk. Others have [decried](https://www.article19.org/resources/blog-uk-online-safety-bill-risks-emboldening-digital-authoritarians-around-the-world/) the bill as a “blueprint for digital repression”.

Furthermore, the weakening of the high encryption standards underpinning platforms like Signal and WhatsApp risks severe cybersecurity threats. In a time where large data breaches and hacks are commonplace, the cryptographic guarantees made by end-to-end encrypted platforms are an essential technology for keeping sensitive information private. The government’s attempts to undermine this technology are short-sighted and place millions of people’s personal and private data at risk. Consider, for instance, that the messaging app Telegram has been central in allowing Ukrainian forces to [securely communicate and strategise](https://time.com/6158437/telegram-russia-ukraine-information-war/) throughout the Russian invasion. If the strong encryption guarantees Telegram’s secret message feature provides were weakened in the way the UK government wishes to impose, this may well have opened the door for these messages to be compromised. While the stakes are perhaps somewhat lower in the UK, the risks of cyberattacks are only growing and it is deeply irresponsible of the government to ignore these concerns as they have.

# Going Forward

Thanks",1673701985.0,35,0,,"[""In the long run, the only type of economic systems that are compatible with sustainability and conservation will be steady-state ones. There may be a few different flavours of steady-state economies. Possibly there is some form of capitalism that doesn't require growth, that could be one of them, but it would be a lot different than current capitalism.\r  \n\r  \nFor a brief description of the the necessary elements of a sustainable civilization, you can check out the Aspen Proposal. www.aspenproposal.org"", ""No. At its very simplest, capitalism as we know it requires endless growth. It's not possible to have sustainable endless growth on a finite planet."", 'Thanks for all the responses', 'In my opinion, the system that created the problem cannot be relied upon to create the solution.', 'No, I don\'t think so. \n\n1. Capitalism is driven by the target and assumption of infinite growth. This is not compatible with the earth\'s limited resources, no matter how efficient and green and equitable the capitalism is. Also, capitalism only provides good standards of living when growth rates are high, exacerbating the problem.\n\n2. Firms maximise profit. The environment inherently has no value in economics beyond that which can be gained by exploiting it. Firms typically maximise their profit over the short-medium term, no longer than 5 or 10 years into the future. So if you\'re the CEO, and you\'re trying to keep your firm profitable to keep investors on board, and you\'re not sure if you\'re going to be CEO in 10 years... Then yes, absolutely you have an incentive to destroy the environment to maximise profit.\n\n3. There can be attempts to solve these flaws via regulations, but firms will ALWAYS have an incentive to lobby against these regulations because it maximises their profit. So no matter how regulated a capitalist economy is, there will always be forces guiding it back to this exploitative state. Firms will always have incentives to lie about their emissions and deceive public & state.\n\n4. Regarding sustainability, general preservation of the environment. Economics has no good way of valuing the environment beyond a use-value. That is, you might value a natural wonder quite a lot, even if you never visit or pay money to preserve it. However, economists use estimates like ""how much are you willing to pay to see/preserve this site?"" to calculate an approximate value. Of course, these are ALWAYS massive underestimates because our values don\'t work like that. These shitty calculations are then passed onto policymakers who try to appropriately regulate the market to reflect how much we value these environmental qualities. If the calculations are way off, the regulation is way under-done. I don\'t think this is explicitly a problem with capitalism per se, but I do think it\'s exacerbated under capitalism because it demands a level of Quantifying Everything to maximise profits.\n\nEtc.', 'Not whatsoever. It justifies itself due to the recognition of scarcity, yet promotes infinite cyclical consumption. There is no address to technological unemployment, resource overshoot, and debt servitude. ‘Resource based economy’ seems like the only viable option', 'Only with strong regulation to control natural monopolies (like utilities), to restrict the economic and political power of any one entity, break up companies that get too big, punish companies that collude to the detriment of consumers, and tax the wealthiest at 90% so that obscene wealth becomes a thing of the past.\n\nWe had some of these things briefly in the U.S., but then Ronnie Raygun and Slick Willy took care of that!', 'I’m going to disagree with everyone here and say that IMO there’s no reason why capitalism can’t adapt to exist in a non destructive way. \n\nPeople cite the need for growth inherent in capitalism as the reason it can’t be sustainable. I’m not sure the growth is inherent in capiralism, but if we accept that as part of the definition  or not, the main means of production is labour and energy and there is really no limit to the energy we can gather. We can still have near infinite growth for a long time to come. The challenge there is in making sure the energy generation is sustainable, which is a separate problem from which economic model we use to arrange our economy.  \n\nA critic might also raise concern over the material used for production. It is true to say that material is finite on Earth and the acquisition of it is detrimental to the environment in a big way, but there is nothing about capitalism which determines the use of materials which need to be mined. We can produce using other materials, we can gather materials from space, we can recycle materials etc. but whatever we do comes down to the demand side of the economy. \n\nAnd that demand side is the problem, not the economic production model. Please can someone tell me why a socialist model of economy and production would be any better than a capitalist one. If the demand for production is equally insatiable as we see now and equally ambivalent about the provenance of goods and the producers fulfil that market demand then it doesn’t matter whether production is capitalist or not. \n\nIf consumers demand clean energy and recycled  products made in a sustainable way then the market will deliver if we attach enough value to it. We can have that all under capitalism.', 'The main problem with this late stage capitalism is that polluters never pay for pollution.

Open Source in Environmental Sustainability - Preserving climate and natural resources with openness,augspurger,19,108bqzw,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/108bqzw/open_source_in_environmental_sustainability/,0,"Open source is everywhere. Its culture has demonstrated how transparent and collaborative innovation can transform modern society, with over 97% of critical digital infrastructure and services depending on it. Open source software accelerates the transition to a sustainable economy by supporting traceable decision-making, building capacity for localisation and customisation, providing new opportunities for participation, and preventing greenwashing by ensuring transparency and trust. Yet, despite the transformative impact of open source culture, its potential within environmental sustainability is not well understood.  


More than one thousand actively developed open source projects and organisations were collected and systematically analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods, providing the empirical backbone for guiding community building, policy development and future investment. We identify common principles embodied within the ecosystem, and several action areas for supporting open source in this critical field more effectively.

I hope we can hold it to about 500ppm (2c-3c temp increase) as per RCP4.5 but we'll probably blow past that and hit 800-1200ppm by the end of the century if we continue the way we are (5c-10c), that is what we are currently on track for.\n\nCO2 concentration has not risen above 300ppm for the last 800,000 years until human intervention. The last time CO2 was above 400ppm was 3 million years ago and the temperature was about 2c higher than it is today, the reason we haven't warmed up that much yet is because there is a lot of lag time in the system so it takes a while for the planet to warm up, there are also other factors that affect temperature than just CO2 such as other greenhouse gases and planetary albedo. Also please note that 3c doesn't sound like much but global average temperature is only 13.9c so 3c is a 20% increase and has many devastating effects on the stability of the climate system, with the most dangerous being the collapse in crop yields due to droughts or storms. \n\n2000ppm wouldn't happen because of humanity, our civilisation would collapse well before then because anything above a 3c rise is going to kill billions of people through starvation, natural disasters, forced migrations, and war, we would not be able to continue emitting ghgs at a high enough level to reach that concentration. I don't have access to a climate model rn (not on the uni system, just typing on my phone) and I can't find any papers on 2000ppm but I'll estimate it at 15c+ temp increase. The planet did hit more than 2000ppm a few times such as in the Ordovician, but trust me you wouldn't want to live in those conditions! Bear in mind other things affect climate and temperature than just CO2 concentrations so you can't one to one map climate from millions of years ago onto today.\n\nWe are currently emitting ~35GtCO2 per year, ppm is going up by about 2.5 a year, we are at just below 420ppm rn so at current rate we'll hit 500ppm by 2055. That's assuming no increase in fossil fuel consumption, with is a big assumption considering we always increase emissions year on year. \n\nJust goggle co2 and temperature graph for proof of correlation. \n\nCO2 rises first, then temperature. There is a lag in temperature increase behind co2 concentrations because it takes a long while to warm such a large object, that's why we aren't already at 2c or more increase, but we are basically guaranteed that will happen with the current co2 concentration eventually.\n\nNo one is claiming all natural hazards and disasters are caused by anthropogenic climate change, they happened before us and will happen after, we are just making the problems worse by increasing the intensity and frequency of disasters. A increase in energy within the \natmospheric system (which is what a temperature increase is) drives more storms because of higher winds and humidity (warm air holds more water). Droughts occur cus higher temperatures drive evaporation, changes to atmospheric circulation shift storm paths which alters where rain is dumped meaning some places will get less rain while others get much more. Forest fires is pretty obvious, increased temperatures and droughts mean fires are more likely. Tides won't change, they are caused by the gravity of the sun and the moon, what's happening is that the vast reserves of water that are currently frozen in glaciers and ice sheets are melting and that water ends up in the ocean to rise sea levels, many of the great cities of the world will be underwater by the end of this century, as will entire low lying countries. \n\nIt's not a doomsday cult, it's just scientific evidence based on what's been observed over the past 100 years, and extrapolation into the future. Why do you think so many of the world's most intelligent and dedicated people believe in climate change? It's not a conspiracy, it's just the truth of the situation."", ""Would be very interested to know what parts of the climate scientific consensus you disagree with exactly (aside from the fact that a consensus exists ofc, it does but that's a whole separate debate). \nFrom your questions it appears that you don't accept the correlation between CO2 levels and global average temperature, which (if true) would be quite surprising, as in terms of climate science the link between CO2 and temperature is very well established and evidenced, and quite widely accepted among the general public, even among climate sceptics. \nIn fact if it weren't for the warming effects of greenhouse gases, the average global temperature of the Earth would be about -18 degrees Celsius (about 0 degrees Fahrenheit). Considering that's a global average, that would be incredibly cold, and most, if not all, of the world would be frozen over and it would hardly be habitable. \nBtw you can easily verify this for yourself, it's simple physics, Fourier did it in 1824, you simply balance the power of the energy coming from the sun (about 10^17 Watts) with the power radiated by the Earth through black body radiation, which is temperature dependent, and rearrange to solve for temperature.\n\nOf course the actual average global temperature is much higher than this, about 15 degrees Celsius, which is because greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, whilst largely transparent to the visible radiation coming from the Sun (hence why we can see in the daytime) absorbs a significant amount of the longer wavelength black body radiation emitted by the earth, heating up the atmosphere and keeping us warm. \n\nDoesn't sound like too much of a bad thing, but the issue is we've pumped a huge amount of extra CO2 (and methane and some others, but mostly CO2) into the atmosphere, and all the extra heat being captured causes more energetic storms, changes to weather patterns, and essentially destabilises ecosystems that rely on predictable and stable weather, which to an extent they all do, including the crops we grow. \n\nAnyway like I said, it would be interesting to know what about that you disagree with, and the evidence you're basing that on"", ""Oh I see, you're a [Stage 2 Climate Denier.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/16/climate-change-contrarians-5-stages-denial)"", '[deleted]', ""There are 37 separate studies showing a hockey stick.

And b) people who are fascists and use the language of environmental activism to promote fascist ideology (eg: we should kill/imprison/control X group of people because they\'re bad for the environment). \n\n(And you\'ll find with these examples that X group of people are always people who do not have institutional power. Versus non-fascist environment activism wich is about examining who has the institutional power and preventing those people from using that power to ruin the planet.)\n\nAs a historical example, Nazis were pro-environmental conservation because they wanted there to be \'pure untouched\' nature for their \'pure untainted\' master race to enjoy.

Samuel Miller McDonald makes his long-winded argument mentioning Bannon as a liberal and therefore an ecofascist (maybe because of Stevie's fabulous failed Italy trip?) Well, Bannon probably has also equated liberalism with fascism, so there is that, but then McDoanbld veers into 'economic liberalism' which I suppose is another way of saying laissez-faire capitalism, definitely problematic but not a true model for economic fascism (because of the anarchic tendencies of extreme capitalism.) Liberalsim has often sought, even if ineffectually, to limit the ravages of laissez-faire capitalism. Progressivism and attempts at American-styled restructuring of monarchial power haven't been without terrible mistakes, but to label liberalism as fascism is specious.\n\nTo me as an environmental activist going back 40 years and more than a few arrests, for whatever, if anything, it is worth, ecofascism can be broken into two distinct and discernible patterns. We can identify them without negating the liberals whom we need to succeed with. The first is traditional, and relates to the malignant tendencies of economic fascism (historically a right-wing conservative trap, not a liberal one, which marries corporate greed with governmental collusion.) Think of the right-wing hedge funders pushing fracking and natural gas as a 'bridge' to clean fuels with govt approval and permits, and then racking up huge profits while blocking active climate catastrophe mitigation, or ExxonMobil trying to game the solar energy market, or even Bechtel making nuclear reactors in China (as if they cared about the mining wastes littering the farms and rivers around African mines or the prison society structure of those nations, including China itself, who turn a blind eye for a payoff!) The second is in the growing paranoidal delusional QAnon and a few of the prepper folks, fed on fears of immigration from non-white refugee populations fleeing the equatorial agricultural collapse and drought regions, and also drilling down on apocalyptic religious fruitcake imaginings.  Fascism usually contains strong religious fruitcake scriptures -- not the transcendentalism of Western Renaissance-bred romantics. They hole up in the wilds with their guns and ammo, booby traps and dehydrated artificially flavored protein mix, and prepare for the invasion of the zombie illegals (too bad for you if you electric car breaks down and you approach their castle seeking a cell phone charger...because they are ready!) These people are fascists. They may have, at one time, been liberal, but now they are QAnon, which is extremely conservative. Some EF! founders had, and some Deep Green perpetual grad students still do fear the refugees from the south, and this is a part of ecofascism as well, albeit a much smaller and disempowered subgroup than the corporate scum, the QAnon preppers, or the climate psychosis driven assault weapons nutjiobs. Samuel Miller McDonald just wants to push some kind of blame game, perhaps to get published, or maybe because some hippie Greenpeace chick rejected him at a Yale sorority party."", 'You ever punch a bully ?

Shit doesn’t just happen, people do things to people.)\n-\n•\t\u2060the difference between taking away someone else's power to harm you vs establishing your own power over someone else\n\n(Tightrope but yes)\n-\n•\t\u2060what harm is actually occurring?\n\n(Well we know the answer and it is not subjective. For instance, climate denial doesn’t get 50% of the consideration just because 10% of scientists are climate change deniers.)\n\n-\n•\t\u2060does the proposed solution actually address the harm?\n\n(Most importantly yes)\n\n-\n•\t\u2060is the proposed solution the most efficient or impactful way to reduce the harm?\n\n(Yes but we can’t get locked in bureaucratic debate on that one. And only the people capable of answering that question need to be asked. We don’t need layman opinions influencing science. Some people put their whole lives into science and some jerk off the street doesn’t get a say.)\n\n-\n•\t\u2060are there other solutions that also would address the harm?\n\n(Yes however let’s not walk 15 minutes away to get a wheeled cart when we could just carry the desired object to the desired location in 3 minutes.)\n\n-\n•\t\u2060does the solution disproportionately burden some people much more than others?\n\n(as seen with the first world versus Third World climate impact argument, we all need to sacrifice, some more than others. It’s not tit for tat. I don’t need to give up wearing false eyelashes and make up because I don’t wear them…)\n\n-\nThe thing about eco-fascism is... If self-defense is your justification, it's just a downward spiral. If your idea of self-defense involves attacking someone else, they are also going to react to your attack with self-defense.\n\n(Yes absolutely but… me physically stopping you from poisoning my water supply is not me attacking you, period! If the products you make, and the people who consume them, are responsible for poisoning the water supply… then same same. Again it’s not subjective.) \n\nContinued in next reply…"", 'Thanks! Excuse the typos. I was pretty tired last night, and there could have been one more, or even two, additional paragraph breaks. \n\nI agree with your post above. The lure of ecofascism is not something to embrace. One can certainly have a sensibility that humans are not the apex of terran creation and that if we disappear then that is just a bio-systemic feedback loop, while not letting it become another terrible reflection of some cultural/racial supremacy.\n\nWe will be called all sorts of things before this is over, and those who would manipulate others for power are no new human phenomenon. Placing blame often has ulterior motives but true mitigative action is often then blown away, as the last climate summit seemed to me to indicate. Keep active. Keep throwing those wrenches. Keep resisting fascist impulses.\n\nBut, in the end, the planetary bio-system does not care.', 'I mean... We\'re all in a car going over a cliff... Do you genuinely think everyone in the car except you wants to die? \n\n(Some people in the car absolutely believe we do not need to slow down, stop or turn. Currently it’s a majority of the people in the car. Cliffs are a hoax…) \n\n-\nIf that seems like the reality around you, I\'d honestly encourage you to expand your community. \n\n(My “community” is seldom the issue, they are not on average behaving in ways we need to worry about in contrast to the masses. Once again not subjective.)\n\n-\nI think you might find that most people actually don\'t want to die. \n\n(of course not, but I may not have time to convince you to change your ways. As Chomsky always says, it’s not coercion or violence to grab a child by the wrist in order to keep them from running into the street.)\n\n-\nIf you\'re just assuming you\'re the only one in the car who wants to live, you might find that you\'re actually making a number of mistaken assumptions about the situation. \n\n(I’m not making any assumptions I’m just trying to open up a debate. I don’t think the post modernist, ‘see things from all angles’ way of perceiving reality is necessarily going to work. If the other people in the car or not paying attention than that subsequently means they’re willing to die in order to avoid being forced to pay attention. If an astroid was headed for the planet people would try and finish their tweets real quick. I mean I’d like to give everybody the benefit of a doubt but I’m a GenXer that’s been on the planet for five decades and this is the extinction rebellion subReddit, correct? 😜 I’m not on the ‘how can we survive and still pile up landfills full of plastic’ sub…)\n\nThen... Do you suppose attacking other people in the car is the most efficient way to stop the car from going over the cliff? \n\n(I’m not advocating attacking, anyone. I’m advocating, keeping them from killing me and my family.)\n\n-\nAre you attacking people who are also locked in the car with you against their will? Are you now so busy fighting one another that the car goes off the cliff anyway?\n\n(This is gold right here, and the likely crux of the debate.)\n\n-\nI guess what I\'m trying to get at is that if you say ""I\'m doing this out of self-defense"" but you\'re hurting other people... They are also going to react to that out of self-defense. And now you\'re fighting each other and the thing you wanted to stop is still going on in the background. I\'m not trying to say everything\'s peace and love etc, but I do think fascism creates more problems without actually addressing the ones you\'re trying to solve.\n\n(I was never arguing for fascism. I was saying that keeping people from poising my water was not fascism. And I was saying about the OG post was that, it’s not a human right for you to be able to poison my water supply just because you want plastic toys and I’m not a fascist if I force you to stop.) \n\nThere\'s really not an environmental issue I can think of that fascism will actually make better.\n\n(AGREED! Fuck fascism. I certainly don’t value the human race so much that I would want us to survive as fascists, although I guess it would still give someone a chance to liberate themselves from that fascism, which is always a great thing to do in life.\n\nHere it is… We can either reduce the population across the globe to 1 million people and we can dig up lithium, copper and run V8 engines all day long full pump air conditioning, and not make a dent. Or we need to stop stripping the planet if we’re going to have 9+ billion people. To stop stripping the planet we’re going to have to convince everyone to give up a bunch of shit they don’t need, and if they don’t wanna give that shit up, we either consign ourselves to death or they must be forced… \n\nI don’t see, for example, why the coal industry or the coal miners have a choice in the matter. Their product is poison and I don’t care about their feelings related to that fact. I am absolutely not an eco-fascist for trying to stop them, in fact, they are the fascists for forcing there poison upon me...) \n\nAnd if you made it this far down, thanks again for the time you put in to responding!!!!!', 'As I’ve said way too many times… the people responsible for poisoning us are still out there. We’re not subject to some ancient headless system dictated by the gods. \n\nHumans only need, in random order… food, sleep, poop, love. We hands down do not need anything wrapped in plastic. We don’t need a new spoiler for our Honda Civic so we can attract Steven/Stefanie in accounting… we chose to play this game and we can choose not to. \n\nIt is no one’s “human right” to destroy the air and water. \n\nConsume, Obey, Sleep, Buy, Submit.', 'For some reason I didn\'t see this comment when you first made it, but, now I saw it, I did in fact read it! :)\n\nI think that part of this is that some people will just throw around the word fascism to mean anything they don\'t like. ""I\'m preventing you from dumping toxic sludge into the river I drink from"" isn\'t fascism, and I think people who say that sort of thing either don\'t know what fascism is, or are not arguing in good faith. So there is that. \n\nMy further thoughts here are... That I think change happens most effectively when individuals don\'t try to address everything all at once, but pick specific issues they\'re passionate about and focus their energy towards that. I believe we can cover the diversity of issues we face more effectively by having a diversity of people who each have their specific thing they\'re focused on than for everybody to be stretched thin trying to stay on top of every issue. And I think the questions I pose need to be tailored to specific issues; that they just can\'t be addressed generally. \n\nSo for instance, if pollution from the cosmetics industry is our primary concern, questions we would need to answer are like... Is plastics the primary area of pollution from the cosmetics industry? What are the primary reasons people use cosmetics? (Because they\'re fun? Because that\'s how people were raised and they haven\'t considered other options? Because they feel obligated to by their jobs or peers?) Is it possible to still have cosmetics without using so much plastic? What are effective ways to drive wider change in the cosmetics industry? Educating individuals? Petitioning manufacturers? Pursuing legislation to bind manufacturers? Is it actually possible to convince people to stop using cosmetics, or do we need to approach from an angle that lets people keep using cosmetics while changing the environmental footprint? I think it\'s also worth asking ourselves... Do we consider it an environmental priority to eliminate plastics from the cosmetic industry because doing so wouldn\'t affect our day-to-day lives at all? Are we placing the burden of ""reduce using short-life plastics"" on people who use cosmetics while continuing to use short-life plastics in other areas of our own lives?\n\nI think for me the most important concept is... Find out what people want, or why they do something, and convince them that what they want, or the reason they\'re doing something, can also be met by the thing **we** want. We have to dig down into an issue until we find the common ground. \n\nYou can\'t do this with fascists... If ""we want X group of people to stop existing"" is the goal, there\'s no common ground there. \n\nBut I think it\'s very often possible to do this when it comes to the environment. If someone wants to dump toxic sludge in the river, why do they want to do that? Can their goal be met in a way that doesn\'t involve dumping the sludge in the river? Coal miners don\'t want the mines to close because that is their livelihood. How can we meet their needs in a way that allows them to transition out of mining coal without upending their entire lives, and without leaving their families and their communities destitute? People don\'t want to acknowledge that the car is driving towards a cliff... Why is that? Why are they in denial? Is it because they feel powerless to stop it? How can we help them feel empowered? Is it because sources they trust tell them the cliff is fake? How can we help them widen their trusted sources far enough to realize that the cliff is real?\n\nI suppose really the biggest overall barrier to change that we face is money, because we have built our society around money. People are forced into behaviors they would not otherwise engage in because they need money, or because they lack money but still need to survive. And people who have money use it to shield themselves from consequences. And that is it\'s own problem to tackle. \n\nBut I think we get a long way by asking questions until we get to the root of things. And I think doing so can help us avoid pitfalls like eco-fascism. That is my 2¢ anyway. :)', 'All great thoughts and I agree with all the practicality. \n\nExcept the part where I have to care that someone wants to wear make up or mine coal… yes they have to care about clean water because they need that. I do NOT need coal and make up. They’re not equivalent. \n\nThis is the base of what I felt when reading the OG post… clean water is a human right. Mining coal is not. Wearing make up might be a cultural right but not in anyway necessary over clean water/air. I believe it may be a human right not to be poisoned by other people’s vanity. \n\nIn the case of cosmetic and coal industry workers, having a livelihood may… may… be a human right but not to do whatever makes you money at the expense of, or in spite of the basic rights of clean air/food/water and the conservation of the land for the long term. \n\nHelp me understand here… back to fascism… because I’m definitely tossing in democracy, anarchy, authoritarianism and fascism here but honestly on purpose.\n\nIf as supreme leader, or thru “democratic” legislation, I dictated no more cosmetics due it’s poison and that it is unnecessary for survival (excluding camo face paint lol)… am I a dictator or am I saving countless humans from being poisoned? Or both?\n\nShouldn’t it be on the polluter to show burden of proof not the victim of pollution?\n\nI still feel this crosspost was basically saying that strict state legislation in the form of ecological/environmental protection could be eco-fascism. I know I’m taking some license there but it got under my skin that whole “human right” part.\n\nIt’s all as unbelievable as labeling food “Organic” rather than labeling food as “Poisonous”…. Why the fuck should real “food classic” (organic) have to defend itself against “New food” (GMO/chemical)? It’s absurd. \n\nMaybe I’m still misconstruing all this again but hands down, current industry is 100% Mussolini style corporate fascism and by forcefully and abruptly ending that in favor of health and environment is not also eco-fascism. And It’s Exxon’s problem what to do with its poison producing employees, they’re complicit at this point so I do not see why the elected democratic state or citizenry needs to care. \n\nNo one cares that tiger trainers were put out of jobs by PETA… why the shit does the state need to protect coal miners when it’s outlawing coal. Figure it out assholes but your not selling that poison anymore.']"

That makes sense, right?\n\nThe end of physical enslavement came about in the USA for the same core reasons as it came about in Egypt, because the technological developments meant that The Economy could prosper moreso by ending enslavement of people and transitioning to machines. This doesn't mean that slaves shouldn't rebel or pursue freedom, it means only that even if slaves were completely pacified and controlled so that they never pushed for their own freedom, a slave-using place (whether Egypt, or Alabama, or Earth) would be out-competed by a place which adopted machinery and gave up holding humans as slaves.\n\nAn example which proves this is the use of draft-animals in fields; horses and oxen aren't today used less because they rebelled enough that it pressured politicians to free them with laws, but because the technology developed to do more on a farm than animals could do, and because the technology gives more power and control and reliability than the animals provide.

Britain oppressing the Irish or the Indians and the USA oppressing Blacks, etc. is a setback to the economic expansion and development and growth that all nations pursue. That is why these nations changed their cultures, and the protest movements to achieve those changes only increased the speed of their implementation - but the changes would have occurred anyway. China is comprised of five distinct ethnic groups, and if they were all fighting one another or a couple of those were trying to dominate another one or two groups, China would not be where it is today in terms of technological or economic development.

Genuine Question: what is everyone’s take on Nuclear Power Plants being implemented in The UK? (Think Hinkley Point C),Vanilladr,33,z56jm7,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/z56jm7/genuine_question_what_is_everyones_take_on/,29,It would appear that they have strong arguments both for and against them. Curious as to what your thoughts are?,1669466166.0,33,0,,"[""It's way too expensive and way too slow.\n\nI used to be on the fence about this but over the last few years the developments in renewables and storage, and the trends in those spaces have convinced me that large investment on nuclear is a bad choice.\n\nSome basic numbers first.\n\nOffshore wind, the hard kind, is now being built with a contracted price of £38/MWh.\n\nHinckley C which is due to come online in 2027 (hopefully) is currently at about £170/MWh, and it's indexed so it keeps going up.\n\nOnshore wind is about 20% cheaper than offshore. It's about the same as utility solar which is about £30/MWh.\n\nYes, those are intermittent but you can build 4-5 times as much of these renewables for the money you would spend on nuclear. That is a staggering amount of additional capacity you are buying. It's means that you can lose a large chunk in inefficient storage and still be miles ahead on cost. Eg Hydrogen (a much overhyped tech btw) has a round trip efficiency of about 30%. But renewables used to make hydrogen which is used when renewables are not available is still better than nuclear all in. And when renewables ARE available you are getting the power for a fifth the cost of nuclear.\n\nSo that's the basics of the cost argument.\n\nBut then there is timescale. This is the death knell for nuclear. It's incredibly simple.\n\nWe have to cut emissions by half in 8 years. In fact, even faster if you care about being even close to 1.5C.\n\nNuclear takes 15 years to build in the U.K.\n\nEnd of story. \n\nIf we spend hundreds of billions on a load of nuclear power plants they will do absolutely nothing for emissions until the late 2030s. In fact they increase emissions because they are very carbon intensive to construct, given they use colossal amounts of concrete.\n\nAnd this isn't a both-and thing because money spent on nuclear is sucked away from renewables. There isn't infinite money to invest here.\n\nAnd then think ahead. A station like Sizewell C (with cost estimated at about £40 billion btw) will perhaps come online in 2037. The learning curve on storage and renewables right now is a very steep upward line. Both are improving rapidly with every year. As above, the generation side of things is already a done deal in favour of renewables. All that is lacking is cheap abundant storage. But in 15 years, based on the current trajectory of development, that problem will be long gone. \n\nAnd so we will have the spectacle of these giant behemoth nuclear power plants coming online at a time when they are completely obsolete. The power they produce will be ludicrously expensive but the grid will be contracted to buying it for 40 years anyway. In hindsight, building them will seem a ridiculously short-sighted decision but one with very long term consequences.\n\nSo that's it. Nuclear costs a fortune and new nuclear cannot help with the climate emergency.\n\nSo, no we must not build any more."", ""I think provided we can make a half decent plant in half decent time it would be much better to be using nuclear power than coal for on demand high power production, obviously more sustainable power is better but, nuclear is a backup that can be safe clean and is something like 100x more efficient than coal.\n\nI think what is misunderstood is that nuclear waste nowadays isn't leaky barrels of glowing goo, it can be made into ceramic and only a small percentage of it takes longer than a few decades to decay so it can be stored on site or can be buried under water tables with oil drilling equipment where it will not be a problem for future generations."", 'Beats burning fossil fuels.', ""If their lifetime costs matched renewable alternatives, and they were wholly owned and run by the state (which lets be honest, assumes all the risk in case of a disaster, so why should we privatise the profits and socialise the risk and clean up costs???) then yeah nuclear would be fine.\n\nBut it doesn't, and they aren't, so it's not."", 'It is important element of a low carbon grid.

Its incredibly expensive compared to almost all the other options and there are many dangerous risks in its operational lifetime. \n\nI also believe a war free world is a nuclear free world so any steps towards denuclearisation will be positive for the human race and the planet"", 'Toxic waste of another form.

Factoring system costs (storage, grid, frequency stability), nuclear and renewable mix is cheaper than 100% renewable.\n\nIt takes 15 year to build the first reactor, but then it will be faster to build the subsequent ones like any other industrial project. And you won't build all your wind capacity in a year, it also takes years due to limited industrial output and raw materials needs. Per MWh, an offshore wind farm consume 6x the amount of copper compared to a nuclear plant, just as an example.\n\nThen a 100% renewable mix needs grid and storage technologies that are just not ready yet, maybe in a decade at the earliest... Whereas we already know how to make nuclear + renewable mix. Let's be pragmatic and don't bet on future technology."", 'CNNC plans to start building a follow-on version, named Hualong Two, by 2024.

Please consider my comment below."", 'Nuclear waste is easily containable, and essentially a solved problem.\n\nThe amount of waste generated by a nuclear power plant over its lifetime is tiny, and there are multiple very good approaches to sequestering it away somewhere where it won’t cause any problems.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4aUODXeAM-k', 'I don\'t think you follow the timing problem.\n\nNo new nuclear will be online for at least 15 years. That means it\'s effectively useless for dealing with the climate crisis.\n\nIt also means we have 15 years to mature the many storage technologies that are already being developed and manufactured now. \n\nRe the batteries btw, we don\'t have to build all dedicated storage. V2G (vehicle to grid) is rapidly maturing into a system that allows grids to pull energy from parked cars when they are plugged in. This effectively allows for dual use of the battery in every EV, electric bus, electric truck etc that is built. That means tens of TWh of available energy once EVs become widespread. In 15 years, that is absolutely inevitable.\n\nAnd storage isn\'t the only way to deal with intermittency. The grid is getting smarter, meaning that load responds to available capacity. In simple terms this is things like your washing machine running when the power is cheap and plentiful. Scale that across not just domestic but industrial demand and you get a grid that does not really need ""base load"" supply any more. \n\nThen add large scale high voltage DC grids which allow capacity and demand to be balanced on a continental scale.\n\nAn example of this is the project that Octopus is investing in where, in 7 years, they will build solar, wind and 4 hour batteries in Morocco and deliver the power to the U.K. over subsea cables. The [XLinks](https://octopus.energy/press/octopus-energy-backs-mega-solar-farm-in-morocco-to-power-7-million-heat-pumps-with-cheap-green-power/) project will deliver more power than Hinckley C (3.6GW), 20 hours a day, and it will be built, not in 15 years, but 5. And at 1/4 the price of nuclear.\n\nEtc etc etc \n\nNuclear is old, slow, expensive and very risky. It is yesterday\'s tech and in 2037, when Sizewell C finally comes online (with good luck and a following wind) it will be completely and utterly obsolete.', ""I an not advocating turning off any nuclear or stopping Hinckley C.\n\nI am advocating not starting new projects now that won't be complete until 2037 or later. It's not the track record of nuclear that it gets faster to build the more you build. It has actually got slower and slower. And where the U.K. has a lot of skills and expertise in deploying renewables, it has very little experience building nuclear. It will take years to build that capacity.\n\nSome renewables like solar take 3-6 months to deploy. Onshore wind takes about a year (once planning is done) and offshore wind takes 2-3 years, again, after planning. The main problem for renewables right now is very time consuming planning. It's in the government's gift to solve that problem pretty much overnight. And if, as looks the case, they finally remove the ban on onshore wind, that will create a large wave of pent up investment in that tech that could deliver 10s of GW starting soon and being built over the next 5-8 years.\n\nI totally agree that we should not bet on unrealistic technology expectations. That's why I am against investment in hydrogen in many sectors. But if you follow this and related subs, you will see that there are genuinely transformational storage technologies that are coming to maturity already. They are being deployed commercially now, unlike the pro-nuclear advocates who seem adamant that SMRs and molten salt reactors will solve anything when there aren't even functioning demonstrators yet. Btw I am not accusing you of that - you have acknowledged I think that we can only realistically talk about traditional thermal plants."", ""We dont disagree on anything, youre completely correct, and to clarify i am 100% on the renewables train. I think its a fools path though to  chose not to build nuclear, whilst going full bent on wind, tidal and solar. The end goal is to stop putting carbon in the air, and protect whats left of the planet. A decentralised battery system of EVs will still require an obscene amount of mineral and metal mining, and if we dont have storage figured out in 15 years then nuclear is the best stop gap. It will reliably create power without buring fossil fuels. If i was in charge we'd be doing everything tbh, no need to choose one or the other. Chuck a shit load of money at nuclear fusion while we're at it."", '""CNNC plans to start building a follow-on version, named Hualong Two, by 2024.

Also on non-windy days a 5x capacity still might not be enough to meet demand - have you looked into that?"", ""So there are a number of reasons why we won't be replicating what China is doing and why it's not quite as wonderful as if first appears.\n\nFirstly, the governance process in the U.K. is nothing like China. China is effectively a command economy. When the government makes a plan, it happens without any meaningful consultation or legal challenge. These challenges hold up projects in democratic countries by years.\n\nSecond, the industry is mature which means a wealth of expertise and experience that the U.K. doesn't have.\n\nThird, the U.K. cannot use Chinese expertise because it just ruled out any Chinese involvement on national security grounds, and given the current animosity towards China across the political mainstream, that's not about to change.\n\nFourth, the costs of building in the U.K. are going to be completely different to China because \n\n- credit is more expensive \n- labour is much more expensive \n- materials are much more expensive \n- land is more much expensive\n- regulatory compliance is more expensive \n\nWhich goes to the fifth point, which is that plants in China are not being built to U.K. standards.\n\nSixth, even in China, they take quite a time to build. The most recent plant in Fuqing was started in 2008 and was only completed in 2022, though reactors were built online along the way.\n\nMoving onto the supply of power from renewables, you don't have to only rely on overbuilding to meet capacity at times of low generation.  There are short and long term forms of storage. Battery storage for short term time shifting is very effective, as demonstrated by the Tesla battery in South Australia which cost $100 million but paid for itself in 2 years.\n\nIn terms of longer term storage, there are technologies like pump storage hydro we already use (this is especially effective over large geographical areas) but there are a lot of other technologies at various stages of development. There are heat batteries which are 99% over weeks (heat energy is a huge chunk of overall demand for energy, as opposed to electricity), there are V2G networks that allow cars connected to the grid to feed energy back to the grid (and the potential capacity here huge when you have millions of 60KWh batteries connected) and even using hydrogen, which is only about 1/3 efficient, if you have 5x the production for the same money, then even cycling the energy via hydrogen is still better than paying 5x as much for all the power coming from a nuclear plant. You only suffer this inefficient cycle with renewables during the 10-15% of the time when wind and solar are both unavailable. The rest of the time, you have an abundance of dirt cheap clean energy. And there are a plethora of new storage technologies in development that will be more effective than what we have now. \n\nAlso note the idea of large grids for more reliable sources of generation is looking very promising. Check out the XLinks project which will bring 3.6GW of power from Morocco 20 hours a day, every day. And it's a quarter the cost of a nuclear plant, with half the build time.\n\nAnd I have not seen any research that suggests we are going to run out of space. We haven't really tapped onshore wind yet, and that can happily coexist with farming. Likewise solar can coexist with animal farming and even some crop farming. As for offshore, the U.K. has a giant continental shelf for its size making for a lot of suitable sites for traditional offshore wind. And when then runs out we can deploy floating offshore wind as Norway and Denmark are starting to do now.\n\nSo I'm still not finding the case for new nuclear very persuasive. Having a bit as an insurance policy is the only thing we should consider. What the government already has planned (Hinckley C and Sizewell C) is so rubbish in terms of cost and timescale that it's very hard to be enthusiastic about that though. We should be striving to find alternatives than dumb, complicated, horribly expensive, horribly slow nuclear."", ""I do agree that the UK isn't China but we should be wide eyed that it *is* possible to do it faster and for less. I don't think we will get to their speed and costs here but we can do much better than we are.\n\nThe original point you made re overggeneration was to say that the intermittency doesn't matter because we can overbuilld. But if you need to overbuiild AND pay for storage, your costs are higher still. System LCOE is the metric we should be looking at here in order to compare apples with apples.\n\nRegarding storage - I'd say that's also still relatively nascent and a lot of the tech you mentioned like heat batteries are still largely in R&D. The path to scaling is not there for many. When we talk about grid flex and demand-side-response, this places additional burden and friction on the consumer to adapt their behaviours - which is something that is already am existential risk to decarbonisation. (Look how long it took for EVs to catch on - electrification is hugely overlooked). I personally don't believe EVs will be used for round-teip storage, but their charging may get a degree of flexibility? Why because cycling batteries degrades them so consumers will be switching that feature off if it ever arrives (just as they switch of the auto-stop-start feature on ICE cars because it annoys them a bit). Perhaps they will turn the feature on, if the payments are high enough, but we just increased the cost of storage, and therefore system LCOE, again.\n\nRegarding interconnection, Id like to see more of that but I don't see that as being politically favourable as energy security increases in importance.\n\nAnother cost not mentioned is grid upgrades. To go big on renewables were going to have tobturn the grid on its head and upgrade all the small, remote connections near the coast into big incoming distribution centers. This is slow and costly too. The true System LCOE of renewables is widely regarded to increase with penetration of that renewable. Some sources don't see penetration being viable beyond 40%. \nAnother corollary of this argument of grid structure is the prospect of SMRs and fusion in the longer term (post 2035). As those technologies achieve maturity and scale, we will be returning to a grid that looks more like today's grid. We'd be undoing a lot of the work from renewables.\n\nGoing back to the costs of nuclear, one prominent organisation (terrapraxis) has some wonderful analysis and plans for 'repowering coal' with nuclear. The beauty of this is you keep a LOT of the expensive infrastructure - turbines, coolling towers and grid connections, and you just switch out the source of the thermal energy.\n\nWhy do I think those other smr/fusio technolocies are inevitable in the longer term? Global energy demand is going up and we are running out of space. That's something you wanted to see reports on... First I'd day do the maths yourself. Look up the UKs total energy use. Look up hornsea 1 (the largest wind farm in the world, completed recently), it's capacity, it's capacity factor, it's size). And do the maths to supply all of the UKs energy (with PERFECT storage) from hornsea 1s - it's not pretty. And if you want to dig into more information or other renewables I recommend Withouthotair.com (if you haven't seen it already). Its been endorsed by bill gates and other prominent climate activists and, at the very least you should understand it's arguments as it forms the basis for a lot of the DECC and BEIS policy in the UK. Youll find some interesting analysis of onshore wind and tidal. Spoiler- there isn't a whole lot to exploit.\n\nFrom a purely numeracy point of view I'm not convinced a non-nuclear world can even add up so even if it *is* expensive we need to accept it's necessity and get building (along with renewables!)"", ""Ran the numbers again myself. You'd need an area the size of the UK in the ocean, all filled with wind turbines to meet the UK's current terrestrial energy use. It's a bit of a contrived argument, but it gives a sense of scale."", ""I think you have a decimal point out there.\n\nHornsea 1 generates 1.2GW over 407km2.\n\nFrom memory, the U.K. uses something like 70GW at peak. That would require ~24,000km2. The U.K. land area is 248,532km2.\n\nBtw Hornsea 1 uses 7MW turbines. The turbines going up now are 13MW, nearly twice as much power and a significantly higher capacity factor.\n\nSo if you wanted all UK power generated by offshore wind (which we don't) it would be, I guess, about 16-20,000km2, so about 6-7% of U.K. land area."", ""You're using electricity, not energy. Electricity is fraction of our energy use.\n\nWith perfect storage, we use 245GW constantly.\n\nPut another way we use something like 2000TWh a year as a nation. \n\nIt's gonna take like 400 Hornsea 1s at 50% capacity factor"", ""Doesn't that assume that energy for transportation switches 1:1 when going to electric transportation? Likewise heating?\n\nIn both cases, they don't. The energy conversion rates are much better when using electric forms of transportation and heating when you measure the energy in vs the energy out. \n\nICE cars are about 18-20% efficient. EVs are about 90% efficient. So EVs require about 20-25% as much energy as ICEVs.\n\nHeating with gas is about 80-90% efficient. Heat pumps are 350-400% efficient. So again, heating with heat pumps requires 20-25% as much energy as gas heating.\n\nSo let's take your 245GW figure and subtract the 70GW peak electricity, leaving 175GW. Then multiply that by 22%, we get ~40GW. Which is only about 50% more on top of existing electricity supply.\n\nAnd btw that's before we do any reform to insulating homes and buildings, or more adoption of public transport and micro-transportation (walking, cycling, scooters, ebikes, etc). Our building stock uses twice as much energy as the best European equivalents so there are huge savings available there. Likewise, we use cars much more than comparable European countries like France and Germany, and far more than countries that really have their act together like the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nLastly you are using too low a capacity factor for new offshore wind. The 13.6MW turbines from GE have a capacity factor of 60-64%, when put in suitable sites of course. \n\nSo I appreciate my earlier figures were incomplete but I think yours are far too pessimistic. And remember, we aren't looking to put all this generation at sea in the first place."", "">Doesn't that assume that energy for transportation switches 1:1 when going to electric transportation? Likewise heating?\n\nYea that's definitely fair! I feel it's maybe appropriate given on the supply side I'm also assuming perfect storage, but your numbers look good up until you take the 175GW and take 22% of it - that's skipping over some other consumption types that don't necessarily have the same conversion (e.g. air travel, industry, heavy good vehicles).\n\nAn aside - we also excluded all of the embodied energy of imported goods. We are nominally a service economy so we currently get to offload a lot of our energy consumption to other nations. Morally, I'm not totally sure whether we should include that in the calculations or not, but it's worth mentioning - and if you do include it, it makes up a \\*huge\\* proportion of our energy ([http://www.withouthotair.com/c18/page\\_103.shtml](http://www.withouthotair.com/c18/page_103.shtml)). I'll leave that to just mull over what is 'fair' in terms of accounting.\n\nRegarding other renewable sources - I think it's also worth pointing out the above link shows that putting wind at sea is by far the best way for us to produce renewable electricity (excluding a slightly fantastical world of large-scale PV farming with the increased need for LDES to shift the peak energy from the summer to the winter). So really thinking about offshore wind as a significant provider of energy is a strong starting point.\n\nBack to storage - so far your numbers haven't included the round-trip efficiency of storage. Battery storage is only useful over a matter of hours. LDES (long duration energy storage) is still at R&D stage for technologies that provide pretty poor round trip efficiency.\n\nI'm just not seeing the argument that renewables-only are a slam dunk and that we shouldn't \\*also\\* start building nuclear. If this is a climate emergency I do think we should be pursuing all options. My position is that we should be looking for a mix of energy sources and that should include nuclear for all the benefits we know (reliable base load, re-use of existing infrastructure, scalable)""]"

I realise that as a leftist I could have a rebellious child that turned into a little fascist or something and vice versa a racist could raise a freedom fighter, but I'm going to go out on a limb and make a generalisation that kids often follow in their parents footsteps from a moral and social standpoint.\n\nPoint two: population growth is already in decline. No I'm not an Elon fan boy. But if we're to solve climate change we need to acknowledge that having kids is important. Consider that if we don't have kids we burden the few of the next generation with the task of looking after a huge population of elderly people without the labour force to do so. Labour is going to be integral to future generations ability to organise a sustainable world and an aging population will struggle to succeed with this.\n\nPoint three: the issues we have are not about the lack of food or arable land or energy or housing.

If profit wasn't the motive behind food, housing, pharmaceuticals and mining we would have enough to go around.  \n\nNow don't take this the wrong way but it really frustrates me when we as individuals are gaslit into believing that we are the problem.

I fly every year to visit my parents. I could stop doing that. I could eat vegan. I could bicycle always.

Probably, it's better, although I think we should all contemplate the extent to which every system that we depend on is embedded within a capitalist matrix.

Nonetheless the capitalists are in charge and nothing we do is going to make that not the case any more.\n\nWe are barreling towards a very difficult future.

What do Amazonian tribes or Papua New Guinea or Bangladesh forest-dwellers need to be educated about, when they know their environment intimately and can survive just fine within it?

Perhaps you\'ve heard about mechanization and robotics leading to unemployment? But perhaps you think that this trend will suddenly halt, or that the drive toward A.I. sentience and complete roboticization of techno-industrial society will yield a utopia of happy, non-breeding, ultra-educated people being catered-to...\n\n>Perhaps what you hate [is] women making choices about their own bodies.\n\nLol. Sure. I control all the women in my life. And if all the free women you\'ve saved (from me) and educated then decide they *aren\'t* happier being childless and laboring as free educated people (with PhD degrees in science and philosophy), if they decide they\'d rather have had three children at a younger age, what then?

If you find that an insult, that is your problem, but the notion of educating the populace is factually a post-Enlightenment one of the liberal West.\n\nI say let women (and men) be free enough to choose having children; you say to push on women meds and tech and \'education\' so that they *won\'t* have children - and yet I am the one ""to force them into conforming with [my] personal belief system""?

Your answer is this:\n\n> Just order govs and corps to recognise the climate emergency, and then make, or aim for, clean alternatives of everything. Now! Simple. An example in terms of planes? Electric planes! Ta da!\n\nA good example.  The first entirely electric plane flew in 1973.  There\'s a very good reason that fifty years later, we\'re still making [eight minute test flights](https://adventure.com/the-first-electric-passenger-plane-is-here/) - it\'s that batteries contain a tiny fraction of the energy, per unit weight, that gasoline does. \n\nWe\'ve put hundreds of billions of dollars into batteries over decades, and they have gotten significantly better, but  by the very laws of physics, a reusable battery will always have a small fraction of the energy density of consumable fossil fuels that are entirely burnt to nothing.\n\nAs long as we keep telling people that they don\'t they don\'t have to do anything, just tell the government to fix it, we will never beat this problem.\n\n----\n\n> we don\'t understand the evidence, science or data.\n\nYou present none of these things.  You aren\'t doing the math or the science, because it would show you how fucked we are.\n\nI\'m 60 years old and I\'ve been listening your argument for fifty years now, while we have emitted 2/3 of all the CO2 humans have emitted in history.   Last year, emissions increased by 6%.\n\nThe idea that individuals don\'t have to give up anything at all, and all we have to do is tell the government to fix it and they will – honestly I just want to burst into tears and cry.

However, while tons of people would use the bridge if it were there, even if all the people who swim pool all their money, they cannot get the bridge built. It has to be decided by a higher authority. \n\nTo relate it back to the pandemic, no amount of staying home would have ended the pandemic. Staying home was still useful in terms of avoiding the worst of it, but there was not a way to keep enough people home to end it. Even if you had armed guards roving the streets, the virus still spread among the guards. The virus is a good analogy for emissions. Even emission’s reducing actions require emissions somewhere, but it perhaps avoids the worst of it. \n\nThe pandemic was ended by a massively subsidized and mandated vaccination program. This would be analogous to governments mandating emissions reductions. \n\nThe individual acts mattered and they can help us avoid the worst consequences, so they are important. However, we absolutely cannot discredit that fossil fuel propaganda has been working very hard for decades, and huge numbers people operate in a basic economics mentality and have no interest in expanding that. They will consume what is produced, shelled from the negative externalities. We still see turnouts under 60% in many modern democracies. That favors the rich propagandists. You’ve got to get people turned out to vote to make those changes. Unfortunately this battle has become a much more up hill one due to fossil fuel propaganda. And without that, it may be the case that more environmentally friendly means to transportation and economic development may have already happened.

If we can cut down on or eliminate some of the propaganda, then perhaps we can start to get through to a few more people on how important top down change is and how it is more impactful than Individual actions, while individual actions are still important for demonstration purposes.

Y\'know how you *might* keep your job if your boss said ""Times are tough and we need to cut wages a bit,"" but if they reduce your pay too much you won\'t keep working there? Well when the minimum wage laws rise enough, employers find ways to cut the least useful employees. And when taxes get high enough, we see ""capital flight"" result. Legislation is far from a cure-all in the real world...\n\nBut let\'s just *suppose* you can raise taxes to the max and prevent capital flight, and the government gets a windfall of funds. What do you think govt. would do with that money? What minimizing of degrowth do you think money does? Degrowth means less wealth, less material goods (less production), less of the things that money delivers. Less expectation of services and luxuries provided by the state. Maybe I lack imagination; please tell me, what would money do to give people fewer services and lower their expectations of what they are owed by techno-industrial civilization? And what would ""financing the transition"" look like?', ""I understand the idea of Pigouvian taxation; what would it take to get such a policy implemented in a system where money decides what is possible? However difficult it might be to get that policy implemented in one nation, imagine doing so for many nations...\n\nIt seems to me a fine program in principle, and completely infeasible in practice. Also, while I'm not an economist, I suspect it is not viable through the lens of economics: the whole reason externalities exist as we know them is because those who can invest capital (for the benefit of profiteering) choose to avoid any costs they can possibly avoid. Thus, forcing them to pay for costs they would rather put upon the general public or pass along to the future will deter those who hold investable capital from utilizing it in Pigouvian-taxed places. Essentially, the whole world would need to implement Pigouvian policies in order to prevent capital from flowing out of any Pigouvian-taxed markets, I expect - and what would it take to get the world to adopt such a policy? The cases where this does not apply (e.g., taxes on sugary beverages other junk foods in a major city) are basically irrelevant.\n\nAnd why should we want to maintain techno-industrial society which has all these problems you seek to mitigate through a taxation scheme? It seems a bit like suggesting that an axe murderer should get some kind of penalty if he wants to behave as he does - like, we should impose a high tax on the knife-gloves [Freddy Krueger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Krueger) wears, rather than eliminate the threat he poses. **Technological society disrupts human nature, while eliminating freedom and wild Nature itself; we're better off without it**, and it will be easier to achieve its end than to try to maintain it with *some* controls to prevent *only its worst and most immediate, obvious* excesses.\n\nIt also seems to me that, while possibly adequate in some cases (taxing sugary beverages or candy bars). in other cases the concept of allowing some social/ecological damages if they have a high cost is rather unacceptable. To what degree does it presently function to prevent pollution that there exists a system of fines to be levied as penalties? Either the companies which need to pollute (or cause other prohibited damages) think they will accomplish their misdeeds without being recognized, or they find it acceptable to conduct the pollution and pay the fine; I suspect that a tax would become an acceptable cost of business, with the taxation passed-along and ultimately paid by the end-consumer of the product, e.g., the government would pay a higher fee for their weapons, or cleaning products would have a higher cost to the users, or wood products would become more costly, and so on.\n\nThe destruction of wild Nature simply cannot be adequately quantified in any way that is relevant, given the inherent limitations of assessing the values of such age-old natural elements to the human psyche, or the entire ecosystem of varied flora and fauna."", 'Not the person you responded to but the answer is all of us.

Degrowth implies a reduction in overall consumption, but more services can be provided by the state to compensate whilst still aligning with degrowth principals.

So let\'s play this out, see what it looks like. What services would increase or simply remain? Transportation like buses and trains and airplanes - for what purpose if not to deliver workers to work sites? To continue tourism and move people around to *not* spend money? Or would dole/welfare payments continue? And what effect would this have on reducing consumption? If the service to be provided is heating and electricity, would that facilitate a decrease of material consumptuon? \n\nAnd here we\'re considering only provision of services to individuals, but the electrical power is generated and provided for industry, and if you want *de*growth how do you expect to achieve it while maintaining *economic* ""growth""?\n\nI totally understand the sentiment to not impose hardships upon the denizens of techno-industrial society, but you want to go from A to Z and not pass through B and Y and all the rest.

We can\'t eat our cake and have it too.\n\nIf you can enlighten me as to how governments will provide existing services (if not more) while reducing production and consumption and the known standard of living as expected by people in wealthy nations, I am interested to hear this.', 'I\'m not condoning any problems, I simply disagree that uninspiring half-measures requiring the pressure from a mass movement and which will meet tremendous resistance are worth pursuing, and instead I advocate for sweeping revolutionary measures which can correct *numerous* things at once and can be enacted by a small minority, a relative handful of people, *in spite of* widespread opposition.\n\nMy unanswered question was/is, **Why should we maintain techno-industrial society with all the consequent harms it has delivered to humanity and wild Nature?** I guess you don\'t see that technological society *requires* the conforming of people and cultures, nor that it constantly erodes human freedoms, and I suspect that you also don\'t have a vision that we can do anything other than continue on this course. I think we are better by far to discard the whole stinking mess of technological civilization, and that such an ambitious and truly deep-hitting revolutionary cause is far more inspiring than meager adjustments to the details of our captivity.\n\nThat 23% figure is a projection of *if* all the proposed and potential and scheduled and under consideration measures would be implemented - but even with that huge caveat, it is still really useless and mere feel-good numbers nonsense: for one thing, if coal usage or CO2 emissions are reduced in Nation X, then other nations will find that there is more coal available to them (and most likely at a reduced cost, given the reduced demand upon the supply), and the same for carbon emissions reduced in one place by any implemented measures, and the same for widespread adoption of veganism. On that note, if the upper class of China could get the peasant class to become vegan, would the upper tier of that society decide to join them in veganism, or would they simply relish their steaks and bacon while also being able to bask in the benevolent humanitarian accomplishment of getting *others* to sacrifice (for the benefit of a supposed reduced CO2 output)? **It works differently in the real world than it does on paper.**\n\nIf some technology comes out to clean the air of pollutants, then the logic will tell some portion of the population that the pollution need not be prevented because it can be corrected. If 80% of cars get more fuel efficient and less polluting, then the most polluting and inefficient 20% will rationalize their continuation because the 80% have done a tremendous improvement for the whole. This is how it goes, the awareness on the whole and the rationale of the lazy or stupid or those unwilling to change.\n\nAnd we can bet that the prisoners of the world are getting the most basic sustenance non-luxurious low-carbon diet available; do you wish to join them to ""save the planet""? Measures whose efficacy require *billions* of others to voluntarily undertake do not inspire much effort or sacrifice, because it is very apparent that any one person will make little impact without all of the others joining, so such routes are simply not inspiring or enticing.', ""> If you can enlighten me as to how governments will provide existing services (if not more) while reducing production and consumption and the known standard of living as expected by people in wealthy nations, I am interested to hear this.\n\nThe key point to understand is ownership vs access. You don't necessarily need to own something to have access to it, you can share access with others. By sharing access you reduce overall consumption as fewer items are needed to meet the same need. Going back to the example of cars, most of the time cars sit idle, as most owners only use them occasionally. Rather than have cars sitting around doing nothing, they can be shared. Whilst it's possible for shared use schemes to be run without government involvement, it is also possible for these schemes to be government-run."", '[deleted]', ""This is 100% true. And there are shared-bike companies which rent out bicycles, and electric scooters; I can easily imagine a government offering these things, but the renter-users of the bicycles and scooters don't treat them too well, and certainly the equipment is not treated as well as it would be if it was an item that an individual had made an investment into. I'll accept that there may be some ideas for how to make the users of shared cars feel invested in the proper care and maintenance of those vehicles, and I'll leave this point aside.\n\nWhat would these cars be shared for, to what purpose? So that people can move around, sure, but for doing what? If people are working, then industry is operating, and degrowth is not in process. If people are not working, if they are not consuming frivolously, for what essential reasons are they moving around with cars (or buses and trains and airplanes)? Does providing cars (and trains and the rest) foster or impede reliance upon local resources and the development of small-community relations?"", 'Me: ""Why should we maintain a rotten system which deprives us of our natural behavior?""\nYou: ""Because we don\'t have time.""\n\nYou say implementing Pigouvian taxation is a quick bandage partial solution which can be applied; how quickly can you and your allies implement this? And what will that applied bandage do to allow techno-industrial society to weather its next upcoming crises with resources shortages or economic hiccups or viral pandemic or technological disruption of the population?\n\nOn the other hand, I propose that we heighten the social tensions and prepare so that when a sufficient crisis occurs, when the existing order is destabilized and in disarray, then can technological society be deposed, overthrown, and technologies vanquished so that humanity can live again as animals free of restrictions from above, in accordance with our biological nature. This would have a deeper impact than any taxation, and take fewer people to accomplish. If you can first get Pigouvian taxation widely implenented in any number of nations, we\'ll see how well that saves us and wild Nature fron the ravages of Technology.\n\nJust so you don\'t mistake me for some socialist utopian dreamer, read [I.S.A.I.F.](https://industrialsociety.xyz).', ""If you want a broader idea of what's possible, perhaps you'll find this video interesting...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NOYa3YzVtyk""]"

This is sterile. Most people do not understand how nuclear works, none of the technical solutions for its long term problems are solved (and can't be solved because the fundamental issues for storage are social not technical). So it's mostly speculation and campism when we get bogged down in technical details. It also doesn't matter, because there are better questions. \n\nWhat kind of society do we want to live in? Nuclear power depends on a massive state security apparatus in a way that no other power source does. It is the most centralised form of power generation known to man, and that concentration of power (electrical) creates a concentration of power (political). Much the same as fossil fuels it requires the existence of sacrifice zones, whether for the storage of waste, the mining of its extremely hazardous materials, or those who live in the radius of a potential failure. The history of nuclear as well as its present, are deeply tied to the creation of apocalyptic weaponry and this is not something you can design out of its technical process. Much like fossil fuels, nuclear is fundamentally tied to the machinery of warfare in a way that a windmill simply is never capable of being.\n\nRegardless of how good nuclear power is technically, it is a technology that has no place in a better future even if it was perfectly safe, technically inexhaustible, and carbon neutral. In the best technical case, it is still bad."", 'Every comment in here is based around the current Nuclear technology that is the same thing as the Westinghouse solution from 70\nYears ago. \n\nThere’s a lot of other nuclear options which don’t require massive plant and massive infrastructure.

For nuclear isotopes (uranium) only 0.72% of pure uranium is available for use as fuel. And only 0.1% of any uranium ore is uranium. And of that only 10% of the energy available in the uranium is actually used by the reactor. This doesn\'t even go into the inefficiencies that a reactor has. Overall you have a mass fraction of 0.0072% for uranium. This gets even lower when you consider the need to enrich uranium in a gas centrifuge, the need to expend energy to fabricate control rods, pressure vessels, and all the auxiliary equipment (even for SMRs), as well as the energy and material spent for extraction and disposal also don\'t forget that uraniumisn\'tfound as an abundant ore, it\'s found as scattered ore meaning your mass fraction got even worse. The end to end efficiency for a nuclear reactor is probably closer to 0.000005% in terms of ""mass to energy"". The only reason nuclear fission is even a viable power source is because E=mc^2 is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nLastly nuclear isotopes mining is terrible for the environment, not only because you have radioactive shit going everywhere. Uranium decays into heavy metals which when the uranium is extracted can go on to pollute their surroundings.', ""Well Per Gigawatt Hour nuclear produces about 3.5 times the green house Gass emission as solar does and about 13 times more then wind power. Cutting green house Gass emission is the main goal here.\n\nAgain the battery's are going to require less materials being mined on a yearly basis because you only need to produce however many you need and then they will last for many years afterwards requiring no additional mining except to produce new batteries (which you don't need to do every year). Completed to nuclear which needs a constant source of fuel and as such constant mining of new materials.\n\nAnd not to mention that with nuclear the material required is highly radioactive and so is the by products of nuclear power generation. The radioactive materials stay highly radioactive for many generations afterwards. But whatever toxic byproducts solar produces isn't toxic for nearly as long as nuclear waste is.\n\nAnd Costa Rica is currently running it's entire power grid off of wind solar and geothermal energy and they are seeing massive cuts to greenhouse gas emissions they are a net Zero country.\n\nCompare that to France which has pretty much it's whole power grid run on nuclear power and they are a major contributor to global warming.\n\nrenewables definitely work sufficiently and the example of Costa Rica proved this to be true."", ""> Floods and hurricanes have been happening since the dawn of creation and were much much more extreme than they the damaging yet puny weather phenomena that we get now.

Whether it is made from fossil fuels or renewables, an *extra* 30% of the input energy is lost in the conversion process, so in the end it is far better to just use the fuel stock (fossil or renewable) directly than to convert it to hydrogen. The conversion and storage processes are so horribly inefficient. Only after fully converting to renewables should we be converting any energy into hydrogen."", '[Nope](https://electrek.co/2022/10/10/wind-turbine-24-hour-power-world-record/)', 'Sorry but you could afford a Tesla but not to charge an ebike?', '[deleted]', 'I mean even with the current climate a tenner of overnight power can give you hundreds of miles of charge.', 'Having challenges\t≠ just as bad', ""I understand how it is made and I don't see the 'it's made with dirty energy' as an argument, since we can in principle use green excess energy. Excess energy is now just not used and is dirty. I don't care too much about the losses or inefficiency. Since it would be 'free', in the sense of excess energy being stored as hydrogen. \n\nI don't believe that hydrogen can or should replace gas or gasoline in all applications. But as a part of the green revolution I see it as a viable energy carrier. Even if its replaced in the far future due to its downsides. \n\nI care about the nox emissions. Those worry me, but hydrogen could still be a net positive if we use it for specific long range high capacity applications in the future.\n\nHaving the infrastructure to serve and produce hydrogen on large scale could also alleviate political problems surrounding water.\n\nAt any rate, a solution to the problems of fossil fuel doesn't need to be perfect. I'm willing to accept significant downsides."", ""It isn't terribly efficient but it is the best option we have for certain industries, like steel manufacture and for powering large ships like container ships, in that case in the form of ammonia.

I was in a Zoom meeting - I always find them so encouraging, uplifting and positive, even if they're necessarily sobering sometimes. Last night, someone signed up and got really vicious about our beliefs and practices, and then started getting equally personal about us as individuals.  I won't share what he said, as I don't want to give his words any more importance, or drag anyone down with negativity, but I'm sure you can imagine the sort of thing. Gargh.

The group were really patient, and let him have his say, but the whole tirade left a nasty taste. We have to be resilient in XR, JSO or wherever, and I've often had to deal with challenging people in my own work. But there was something particularly venomous about his abuse. SUCH a bad vibe from him! I'm sure more than one of us felt like having a go back, but no one did, which was to our credit.

I'm sure others here have had experiences like that. How do you deal with them?

My name is Nick and I’m currently finishing up my University studies studying Geography and Data Science (with a heavy focus on Geospatial Data, GIS, and Earth Science). I want to expand my portfolio beyond what I’ve done in my classes and figured you guys could help me out.

I am currently putting together the governance for a governance system which I wish to be democratic in nature. I believe this system needs to answer to the people who I designed it to serve for it to succeed to its full potential especially in the long term. 

It does not stop up traffic or interfere with commerce, it simply goes around the entrenched fossil fuel interests and puts them out of business without negotiation or compromise if successful, or even better, possibly in exchange for the ending of taxation, if our leaders chose to make it happen faster.

[https://youtu.be/SVR-uuxPjBA](https://youtu.be/SVR-uuxPjBA) (42m discussion on governance and strategy)

Right now the fossil fuel industry controls the energy markets on which everyone else depends including our governments. Until there is an alternative economic model proposed that is supportive of freedom, accountability, and democracy our democratic institutions will become less and less democratic as fossil fuel allies in government increasingly control state violence. If we want to win the climate race we have to build a competing economic system to the one set up by the fossil fuel oligarchs where we all have a seat.

My goal is to give politicians the choice between demanding taxes to support the fossil fuel industry, or ending taxes in cooperation with the green energy industry and its countries own citizens.

Good luck with your plan.', ""Firstly, sorry about your health issues, and thank you for working towards building a better world despite those setbacks.\n\nWith regards to Transition Towns, best way I can think to describe it is a network of local community groups working towards improving sustainable practices in their local areas. These groups have a wide range of projects, including work in the fields of food, energy, transport, etc... Also, they work alongside local governments instead of against them in order to further sustainability goals. Transition Towns are focused on building the alternative rather than just advocating for it, having ideas isn't enough, it's about working with others to see them come to life.\n\nSome Transition Towns groups have experimented with alternative currencies, for example the Totnes Pound was an alternative currency used in Totnes, England (the place with the first Transition Town):\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totnes\\_pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totnes_pound)\n\nAs the Wikipedia page for the Totnes Pound suggests, part of the reason for this venture stopping was the move towards a cashless society. It's highly unlikely that spending habits will change any time soon to bring a resurgence of cash use, so an eco-focused cryptocurrency could be a new way to have an alternative currency thrive in an economy that is more focused around digital money transactions.\n\nSpeaking personally, I'm not an advocate for cryptocurrencies, and would much rather see a growth in time banking, but if it can be shown to work well at a local level then I'm much more likely to trust that it might work at a larger scale. As I'm fairly sure you'll already appreciate, trust is a key factor when it comes to currency, and in my view experiments in local community groups are the best way to test out new currencies, as it's easier to build trust amongst people you can interact with in the real world.\n\nIt's possible that you can reach out to your local Transition Town group and see if they're interested in a cryptocurrency-based ecology-promoting digital currency. Alternative currencies have been tried in Oregon before, so there may even be people with experience of them that can provide insight into how well they worked in the past, to help improve future attempts:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_community\\_currencies\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States#Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_community_currencies_in_the_United_States#Oregon)\n\nHope this was of interest.

I only use the NFT technology for portability if the owner chooses to pack it up minimizes energy costs further. The wasteful ""mining"" aspect is removed completely and replaced with green investments and the sale of green energy to make the Energy Credit a ""stable coin"" as the proof of work. Basically this is more like a cross between a war bond and the Star Trek energy credit to create a green energy commodity coin. A new kind of ""gold standard"" but with something more important to the economy, meeting our needs with green energy.', ""Thank you for the extra information, does seem like an interesting twist on the most common approaches to cryptocurrency.

Eventually it they will mature in time from energy revenue streams owned by the system (yet to be sponsored by a partner, you for example) this means when they mature $1 is put in the bank to back their matured value as EC which means you effectively double your money if you decide to keep the ERC and not spend them or trade them.\n\nFrom the moment that you have the sponsorships the infrastructure you are getting credited for your interest in the sponsorship which means you receive your interest in energy sales in fully backed Energy Credit stable coins (With the $1 in the bank to secure the stable value)\n\nThe system half of the energy credit revenue goes towards the system maintenance, healthcare subsidies, small business services, student debt elimination, basically what the governments say are not their job but are necessary to healthy economies and societies.\n\nIdeally this is integrated into the financial system so Banking customers can get low/no interest loans that are secured by ERC for their private sponsorships. Since the ERC will eventually double in value the bank knows it is a safe loan and since we are the partner in the sponsorship everything is completely secure. This means unlike today, you don\'t need credit to get credit, because everyone is working off of the systems ability to secure that credit. This is how it can accelerate its allowing livelihoods in the age of automation and the elimination of poverty.\n\nThe great advantage of the fossil fuel industry is their control of credit markets because they are the backbone of the modern economy. If you replace that backbone of green energy and put the power of that credit in the hands of the people you truly do have democratic control of the means of production as long as it the governance of the currency system is democratic. Today we have democratic governments but corporations have the  power and control over the energy industry. What if everyone on the planet had access to the credit rating of the energy industry to create their own energy and sell it to the grid to provide for their families, bringing them out of poverty or keeping them out of poverty in the age of automation.\n\nThat is why I am asking for input from outsiders to create this democratic system. Most companies answer to shareholders but what happens to peoples freedom over a long enough timeline if one person, or family, has controlling interest of global energy production.\n\nThat part is in the deep dive video.

I'm a general public.

How would you convince me that the climate change is our fault (humans) and it's not just a regular cycle that happens every few thousand years.

Don't take me wrong. I'm not here for conflict, I'm looking for a constructive discussion with arguments and needless to say I'm open minded to all your arguments and opinions.

I'll start. In my opinion we have a big impact on our surroundings and we surely sped up climate change. I can see environment around me changed a lot in just a decade but what is your solution for this? 

I really can't understand those protests you are doing. Stopping traffic, glueing, destroying. This is your way of winning peoples favour? You are only making yourself look really bad and it has quite the opposite effect. 

So now think. Think of some smart protests. Think of how to throw that rock like David and overpower Goliath. Think how you can get people's hearts on your side. Use arguments, research, try to think of reasonable solutions to climate problem. Then people will listen.

Right now as I see it, no offense btw, all climate activists accomplished only one thing. Hate from general public instead of sympathy.

Looking forward for your ideas, arguments, solutions, all you can think of. As I said, I'm looking for discussion to maybe change my view of the world as well as yours

As far back as the 60s fossil fuel companies knew it was going to be a catastrophic global crisis. Our information has only gotten better since then. And there are still corporations and politicians who refuse to do anything. Now we’re at a point where there may be no way to mitigate the worst consequences. There are tipping points that we won’t be able to come back from no matter how much we change. We have already passed some and are dangerously close to passing others.

Drops in the ocean. A large amount of the damage is done by a small amount of the global population. Whether they are divided into continents, countries, economic brackets, or religion/politics.

Some people know that their little effort is not enough, it requires all of us and all industries to drastically change. Stopping the tidal wave of commercial environmental abuse is mission critical.

The earth is a contained system. We occasionally get interstellar additions, and have some egress of gasses and etc. But largely it is like a plant in a bottle.

The fossilised carbon deposits, coal, crude, natural gas, are all stored energy. Releasing that is shaking up our bottle so much that things have already started dying!

Protests need eyes and we have billions of them engaging with social media every second. Content creators, influencers, corporations, public figures, and the media all use sensationalism as a way to get people to engage with their content and their message.

Art and Oil are priceless/worthless depending on perspective. Same goes for the earth... Anyway here's some notes about art museums,StoopSign,7,yc355v,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/yc355v/art_and_oil_are_pricelessworthless_depending_on/,0,"originally a comment on the recent small potatoes Monet protest. The post details the culture within an art museum and how it can be subverted. I didn't do this as a climate protest or a protest in general. Just fuckin around with general opposition towards the formal art world. 

-----------

I have a love/hate relationship with high art and the art world. It is the absolute perfect target. It's the epitome of shock value performance art and protest. Those artists died poor and generarions made tons of money off of it. Art and antiquities is the most elite trade that exists outside of oil. It's a target secured only against theft. The louvre doesn't fuck around with the Mona Lisa and could have you hanged too (historically). Outside of that the art museum security is mall level, with dosents and college helper volunteers.

-------------

I've been to a several art museums and it's all like that. The general public is assumed to hold reverence for what's inside and we do and I do. When customers have to pay it's more reverant and on free days more rambunctious. I used to go to every monthly free day pre-covid and end up spending money on drinks charting with baristas. It's a great place to randomly talk to random people too tested limits mostly there but I've done sly things in other art museums. You can be part of a meh design exhibit and nobody will stop you for awhile. You can do anything in the dark video rooms. Everything is unsecured. At two museums either doors, passageways, offices, or dark theaters, had doors you would expect to be locked but they're not. I've been able to touch or slightly pull against two expensive (but niche) artists: paintings from the wall without being noticed overtly.

------------

Although at one, a college helper girl said ""don't you like that [specific artists] painting?"" when I was on a free day with someone. Still nothing came of that particular incident. I was definitely noticed but up until they know you've crossed an obvious line, they won't do a damn thing. It's not human nature to. It was more true because they knew me and that I wouldn't really mess up their precious art.

------------

I haven't been to a free day since covid and don't know if or where they exist but it would be a perfect place for a protest complying with all laws except noise laws. You can protest in odd ways.

tl;dr: play tag or freeze tag for the climate in an art museum

Edit: Important to note that I'm in the US but I think Europes medium sized cities, smaller museums, would probably have similar security. I'm not gonna name the cities but the two with slack security both had populations of 600k but in the major museum I was able to add a cigarette a piece that was retro junk. A couple other people added masterlocks that hadn't been clipped.",1666589681.0,7,0,,[]

How do you deal with so many people hating us?,ScreenHype,12,ybqhnc,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/ybqhnc/how_do_you_deal_with_so_many_people_hating_us/,25,"I'm a very sensitive person, and it makes me so sad when I see commenters online saying all kinds of nasty and untrue things about climate activists. They treat us like we're evil, but we're not hurting anyone! We're non-violent!

All we're trying to do is save the planet, they all live on that planet, they should be grateful. But even the ones who aren't climate change deniers still don't seem to think it matters enough to actually do something. It just makes me sad :(

How do the rest of you deal with it when you see horrible comments?",1666552964.0,12,0,,"['Good question. I\'ve learnt to see hate like the weather. Rain. Or noise. Static. If you try to do ***anything*** substantial in this world, good or bad, you will feel hate. Like inertia, a type of gravity you feel - only when you\'re moving. \n\nMy thinking is, you should expect, anticipate, and learn how to deal with it unfortunately. A kind of adult & depressing realization.\n\nThe question is not ""How do I stop people hating me?"" The question is, ""For what do I choose to suffer hate on behalf?""\n\nFor example, cars have seat belts, so when you feel inertia, you don\'t fly out your seat. Or another example is, hate is like wading through thick mud, instead of regular walking on hard ground. Pioneers will encounter mud when walking where there are no pavements. Build a seat belt.\n\nHumans can be animals. They react with hate impulsively. Before thinking. Hate can be cathartic. Most people are genuinely not aware they\'ve bullied people or have contributed to bullying. This is how racism was born. Or Misogony. People thought it was acceptable to be prejudiced because many were vocalizing it. Some things you should not vocalize.\n\nI love this scripture from The Bible, that teaches Christians how to deal with hate:\n\n***""Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.""***\n\nMatthew 5:10', 'In my experience, people in XR are lovely, so come to actions and meetings in person to make friends with more people who make you feel good.\n\nPersonally, I’ve just gotten used to the fact that some people will hate me and there’s not much I can do about that, so I focus on other people/things', 'Also, remember the planet will be just fine. We are trying to save it from becoming uninhabitable for our species, but the planet itself will cope. We won’t.', 'If you’re sensitive make sure you’re not projecting your own insecurities onto climate change, maybe learn some Stoicism and accept that not everyone sees the world the same way as you. Maybe learn to be reassured in yourself and get better at dealing with confrontation without getting upset.', 'In this early stage of the movement, powerful and influential people will try to prevent the movement from gaining more supporters. These people maintain their financial situation based on the current systemic ecocide and have a lot to lose from organized boycotts and the like. They will therefore employ social media resources to discredit the movement in several ways. \n\nFirst, they will always show protestors as acting alone, marginalized, or radical. This is to convince would-be climate activists that activism is stupid, uncool, or that the movement is doomed to failure. The worst for them would be if lots of us all started realizing at the same time that we\'re feeling pretty damn similar about stopping the extinction of the human race -- that stopping it has to happen now. \n\nSecond, they will employ tried-and-true disinformation tactics to skew arguments in online comment sections, talk shows, etc., one way or another. Often, many colluding actors will work together online to create the illusion that all climate activists are misguided in some way, or are actually hypocritical at the base of their arguments, or have scumbag leadership, etc, etc. Again, the goal here is to win hearts and minds and to stop people outside the movement saying ""you know what? I want to join whatever they\'re doing."" Just literally Google ""disinformation tactics"" to learn more about specifics. Of course we should keep an open mind when the critic\'s intention is ultimately to enhance our ability to accomplish our goals, but know that disinformation tactics do exist and are practiced every day.\n\nIf soft tactics like this in social media, print, and TV news don\'t work, and the movement is still gaining in popularity, the vested interests will move to real-life infiltration of activist organizations in order to spread chaos and disrupt organized activity. Then the aforementioned media can point to the disruption and continue to disparage the movement. ""Look at these clowns, they can\'t even do X,"" or ""These activists are dangerous; look at the damage they caused."" The goal in this stage is disruption of activist guerilla tactics as well as further PR warfare.\n\nFinally, if the previous tactics still don\'t work, the vested interests will move to outright violence, kidnapping, and intimidation of activists and their friends and families. Look at Hong Kong for a recent example of this, although there are many ongoing examples now and throughout history.\n\nSo, given the massively powerful vested interests who work against climate activism, the potential to have your name dragged in the press (or much worse), and the very real possibility that the movement itself might fail, why participate in climate activism at all?\n\nI can\'t answer that question any better than the journalist and author Chris Hedges already did:\n\n""I cannot promise you fine weather or an easy time. I cannot pretend that being handcuffed is pleasant. If we resist and carry out acts, no matter how small, of open defiance, hope will not be extinguished.\n\n""Any act of rebellion, any physical defiance of those who make war, of those who perpetuate corporate greed and are responsible for state crimes, anything that seeks to draw the good to the good, nourishes our souls and holds out the possibility that we can touch and transform the souls of others. Hope affirms that which we must affirm. And every act that imparts hope is a victory in itself.""', ""You can't help being the way you are, and you can't just switch off your sensitivity. Nor should you. \n\nYour sensitivity is a credit to you, and a gift you can use. XR and other protest groups can reach people through gentler, kinder means too. We can give our reasons for what we're doing. Some people may   -and do - come to understand. \n\nIf people are obnoxious, rather than arguing with them, I try and steer them towards the science. What we believe, and what we state, is supported and underpinned by science in a BIG way. If anyone wants to deny that, they had better argue with the IPCC and NASA!\n\nThe thing that riles me most is being called 'deluded' and a nut job, by people who haven't even looked at the science at all, and don't even seem to get the basics of what we're fighting for.  \n\nAnyway, don't stop being you.

The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record.\n\n> The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\n\n> In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate. Yet based on current national climate plans, global warming is projected to reach around 3.2°C by the end of the century.\n\nI'm not sure what you're doing here if you think climate change is something you can just shrug off and stop worrying about and it'll be fine."", 'My flippant advice would be to go back in time 50 years to when we could do anything about it. The methane-generating feedback loops that were predicted have been triggered and we are locked into significant temperature and sea level increase. Many of our economies (especially ours) are dependent on food imports that tie us into the global economy that was built upon, and has no ability move away from, the rampant pillaging of nature. Marx wrote about this in 1848 in the communist manifesto, likening our modern bourgeois society to ""the sorcerer, who is no longer about to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells"".\n\nWith actual advice, much of is to consider not our inalienable rights, but our inalienable responsibilities to life on this planet and to do what we can to live respectfully. Mining for solar panels (and throwing them in the landfill) so that we can continue with our consumer society is not living respectfully, nor meeting our responsibilities. Regarding those who profess the virtues of ""renewables"", I wonder if they think it is fair that the land that will be ravaged is not their own, and many of those who do the mining will not see the fruits of their labour (being economic, or quite literal, slaves in places). \n\nIt seems to me that any change requires us to break away from huge supply chains and modern luxuries and move towards living locally, which will in turn require us to grow more food and *our own* food. Small-scale farming is much more land-efficient than field-scale, the problem is that it is more time-intensive. Well, where we\'re going anyway will leave a lot of people with more time, so people need to use it to grow their food. Obviously, this will reveal current land-ownership as a major problem, so somehow this will need sorting. Only then will we be able to do anything ourselves without being held to ransom by the real threat of empty shelves.\n\nThere will be no saving by the machine that we have elevated to the position of godhood. Although many of us are atheists, we are deluded to think that we do not share a religion of which a large part is the global political economy. Belief that we are capable of unlimited power and knowledge is rampant and should be enough to send off alarms that are living within a global cult of only seemingly superhuman hubris. Frankly, there is nothing much to be done but discourage simplistic solutions that will lead to complete totalitarianism and widespread regional genocides.\n\nI\'m really ranting now and I don\'t really have a direction beyond - be a grieving witness to the collapsing biosphere, accept societal collapse as a consequence, and do what you can to remove yourself from this suicidal system so that you can maybe to a little good later down the line.', 'The world was supposed to end 20 years ago according to climate hysterics of the 70s.

There is time to amend the Bill!

The hearing and review process so far and as documented in Transforming Government Procurement, environmental / climate change perspective in so far as it relates to procurement legislation and processes will be managed via policy, guidance and best practice.

This may not have the impact of addressing climate change with the urgency, focus and pace that is required. We have already seen this. It is not sufficient to leave such an existential threat to our country, current citizens, future generations and frankly the world to shifting policy priorities over time from government to government.

From a Departmental, Contracting Authority and a supplier perspective creating binding legal obligations on all parties to absolutely enshrine climate change in designing requirements for service, goods and works and assessing suppliers suitability to contract with the public sector is a minimum requirement. It will enable all parties to invest with confidence, build capability, build expertise and skills to make a positive difference.

If this obligation is enshrined in the Procurement Bill this will require a fundamental and critical shift in behaviour and obligations for all parties involved in public sector procurement and the relevant supply chain. This approach will help ensure that no public spend (taxpayers money) is used in a manner that does not either contribute to positive climate impact or as a minimum stops further contribution to climate change.

The following cult criteria and cult behaviors are the best way to determine what makes a cult:\n\nA charismatic leader: Cults always follow a charismatic leader, living or dead, whose teachings are considered of the highest importance. This leader may be considered a genius, or may be considered a religious figure like a messiah or prophet.\n\nIdeological purity: Members are strongly discouraged from questioning the cult\'s doctrine and any doubts are met with shame or punishment.\n\nConformity and control: Cult leaders often exercise an extreme degree of control over members\' lives, including dictating what they can wear and eat and what kinds of relationships they can have.\nConformity is also enforced by group members who police one another.\n\nMind-altering practices: Sleep deprivation, chanting, meditation, and drugs are often used to break down individuals\' defenses and make them more susceptible to cult ideology.\n\nIsolation and love-bombing: It is common for people in cults to be encouraged to cut contact with outsiders, including close family members. Within the cult, new members are often subjected to love-bombing, a practice where new initiates are showered with love and praise to bring them deeper into the cult and foster a sense of belonging.\n\nUs-vs-them mentality: Cult members are often encouraged to see the cult as superior to life on the outside and to feel that those outside the cult lack understanding or insight.\n\nApocalyptic thinking: Preparation for a supposed apocalypse or cataclysmic event is a major characteristic of many cults, especially cult religions.\n\nTime and energy: Followers are expected to dedicate huge amounts of time and energy (and often money) to the cult to the exclusion of their own lives, interests, jobs, and families.""\n\nExtinction rebellion and all the off shoots meet these criteria. Before you claim not to have a leader I\'m constantly hearing cult members refer to sir David king as the genius that has all the answers.\n\nThe mind altering isn\'t being done by drugs but by propaganda.\n\nYour echo chamber is very isolating.\n\nAnd I need not comment on the other points lol because the worlds going to end right? And its the nasty oil companies and billionaires that are getting in the way of saving the planet.\n\nThe thing about cults is the members will never admit they\'re in a cult.

It's also undeniable that, in 2022, it's horrendous to even THINK about continuing along this path or new investments in oil and gas etc. The science is equally illuminating about where this could be leading. \n\nAs governments have not been open, frank and honest with the people - and it's clear that they repeatedly avoid even mentioning the issue - the scientists have had to communicate directly with the people.

Let's tackle the myth that car exhaust (road blockades) create any significat amount of pollution.,veneratio5,5,y4ru86,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/y4ru86/lets_tackle_the_myth_that_car_exhaust_road/,6,"An idling car is absolutely insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

It's a myth/naive/uneducated perspective to say that **driving/running a car's engine** (specifically) creates any substaintial amount of pollution. From a global point of view. Let's put things in perspective:

[Artical: 16 cruise liners create the same amount of pollution as ALL the worlds cars](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1229857/How-16-ships-create-pollution-cars-world.html#:~:text=The%20most%20staggering%20statistic%20of,fuel%20as%20small%20power%20stations.).

It's important to tackle this myth about pollution created by **car exhaust** because of the amount of road blockades our movement is involved in. This myth is peddled by an uneducated mainstream, along with big-oil funded propaganda, and used in fallacious ""hypocracy"" or ""gotcha"" arguments against climate activists. The term ""carbon footprint"" was coined by big oil company BP; as if Carbon (dioxide) is the only source of pollution in the world. There are many many other types of pollutants.

It's also important we distinguish the difference between driving USED cars and encouraging production of more NEW cars. The industry and industrial practices around creating MORE/NEW cars certainly needs to be addressed as a major contributer of pollution. We have plenty of cars in the world right now, without building new (non electric) ones. We should be focusing our attention on industrial practises, electricity generation and global govmental policy, not on individuals and their transport.",1665850359.0,5,0,,"['I agree with the general gist of what you’re saying, and yet there is some “low hanging fruit” also which is egregiously wasteful and stupid. \n\nOne can kill prey with a thousand cuts.

Almost every other social issue had to wrestle with the same questions. The suffragette had to become extremely annoying to get moment.

They often get convicted with [years of prisons](https://www.opb.org/news/article/washington-valve-turner-activist-sentenced-to-prison/). So there is that.\n\nThe bigger point is that it is questionable whether radical activists should go to such extremes to make a difference. Malm makes the argument why it may be necessary, and honestly he has a point. Maybe if we keep seeing the world devolve in climate catastrophe with close to no collective action to advert it, this might become the last resort of activists. But as of today, I would bet that most climate activists would vastly prefer to rely on civil disobedience.', 'And then you get thrown in prison and they build a new one.  How is that going to help?', '>As an aside, have we had any confirmation they knew it wasn’t going to be harmed?\n\nIf that is what worries you, here is the answer from an article in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/14/just-stop-oil-activists-throw-soup-at-van-goghs-sunflowers): ""The canvas of the painting is protected with a glass screen, a factor Just Stop Oil said they had taken into account"".  \n\n\n>Does the damage matter as such?

And life on Earth will be so much harder for everyone with more hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, wildfires, pest and diseases outbreak, famines, etc.\n\nSo no, I don\'t the symbolic damage done to a painting under a glass justify inaction when we are currently on a trajectory to climate catastrophe with human suffering to a scale never witnessed in human history.

Looking at the news coverage and how it is all over Twitter, it worked.\n\n>I would however question the optics for the movement, to my earlier point.\n\nThat is usually the core argument and one of the central questions in the movement.  While climate activists often personally agree with the method, it is common to wonder if that would not be counterproductive by alienating the people we are trying to reach out to. And I get it.

So there is no perfect way to protest. Either the actions are not reported and effective, or we have to accept that they will be more disruptive and create a backlash. I honestly don't have all the answers, but if history is of any indication, actual social change rarely happens without disrupting the status quo and ruffling feathers.

The only way to enact the change we need to see in a timely manner is to organize to change the system we live in.', '>No one wants to give up the luxuries and vanity items that fossil fuels give us. That includes those advocating for getting off fossil fuels\n\nFirst, that is not true. While it is not the most popular approach, a growing minority of people are starting to wake up to the existential threat caused by climate change and ecological collapse, and are starting to make changes in their lives. [A survey in 2021](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/07/few-willing-to-change-lifestyle-climate-survey) found that 77% of the people polled were willing to accept stricter environmental rules, but only 18% were willing to reduce meat consumption. It is not enough, but it is a start.\n\nI am one of these people willing to accept a lot of change. In the last two years, I have done as much as I can to change my habits:\n\n* I first reduced meat consumption by 90% for a year and then decided to become vegan when I realized I did not miss meat, especially with plant-based alternatives like impossible meat.\n* I try to only buy objects second-hand on eBay unless when it is a step too far (hygienic products, underwear, etc.).\n* We started to buy all our food organic whenever possible\n* We started growing food in our backyard\n* We started composting our food scraps with a worm bin in an apartment and now a compost pile in the backyard.\n* I tried to fly as little as possible and stopped going on vacations far away.\n\nIt is far from perfect. Because I have family on another continent, and I can\'t just tell them that I\'ll never see them again because of my concerns with climate change, I\'ll have to keep flying at least once in a while. I am not happy about it, but after looking for an alternative (cruises are even worse than planes), I accepted I couldn\'t bring it down to zero, but I\'ll try to reduce it to once every few years.\n\nWhile all these changes in individual habits are great, they are missing the bigger picture. It is great that more people are becoming aware of the impacts of their lifestyles. Seeing these changes in most of the population would be even better. Regardless of whether we think individual actions are ""only"" responsible for [25% to 50%](https://bonpote.com/en/are-individual-actions-really-responsible-for-25-of-emissions/) of GHG emissions, it is clear that they are not enough to effectively address the climate crisis.\n\nWhat is important is to realize that we need everyone and every part of society to work together and contribute to these changes. In the end, both individuals AND organizations have to make changes. However, changes made at the collective level have more influence and impact than individuals. A good example is the CFC ban in the 1980s, imagine if governments had asked people to stop using these products instead of banning them. So while it is great that more people are making changes in their lives, that should not distract from the fact we need to see systemic collect change as soon as possible.', ""XR regularly makes mention of changes people can make and promotes them such as not flying. \n\nBut a founding principle is not to blame individuals. We have a systemic problem that requires systemic change. \n\nIf everyone is shitting in the swimming pool you don't solve that by asking nicely and promoting not shitting in the swimming pool. You demand the pool owner stop people from doing it and make other alternatives available."", 'Transport and heating also include large impacts that are beyond the ability of individuals to control.\n\nFor example, the shipping industry is around 2.2% of all CO2e emissions globally, and most of that is related to the shipping of goods. Even if you stopped all your purchases of imported goods (which is highly unlikely to happen), the shipping industry would continue as some of what is being shipped relates to goods for industry.\n\nAlso, I don\'t have the figures for heating to hand, but consider all the buildings that are heated or cooled that you can\'t control the energy use for. Shops, office blocks, hotels, etc...\n\nTo be clear, I\'m not saying don\'t take personal responsibility where you can. I do my bit, and it\'s worth doing what you can as an individual. However, those changes are not enough to tackle the scale of the problem, and there\'s a danger of being placated by ""doing your bit"" on an individual level, which takes away energy from the more radical changes that are needed to truly tackle the problems head on. In other words, if you\'re serious about tackling climate change, focus more on collective action over individual action.', 'What will happen when it potentially bites us in the ass one day because we are protecting those who are disingenuous?

Climate Change & Global Tipping Points.,valuematchuk,29,y2c156,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/y2c156/climate_change_global_tipping_points/,1," 3 minute video that explains the context of 1.5C change and its importance.  


The key points:  


1. The rate of change in temperature in the last 70 years is unprecedented in the planets 4.5B year history  
2. We are currently on track for approximately 3.0C change in temperature  
3. This rate of change is already impacting several Global Tipping Points  
4. If these Tipping Points are reached they could then further drive up rising temperatures outside of any further human intervention (positive or negative)  
5. If we get to 4.5 / 5.0C change that threatens humankind on earth, so in that context 1.5C change seems far more critical and relevant number (ironically 1.5C on top of our current trajectory threatens human existence - and at the moment we are not managing or seem capable of keeping to the Paris target)  


This context is incredibly important in how we view the actions we are taking today, the UK Government priorities, and this why we have launched the petition around procurement. 

We clearly understand the various global and national challenges of COVID, war in Ukraine, inflation and energy prices, however, to shift a global system requires consistency of focus, strategy, management and concerted action over decades, as well as dealing with current challenges, there are just no credible trade-offs here.  


It is also not a credible solution to any short term challenge to contribute more emissions to climate change that really makes no sense when you consider these timelines.

Just think about that, about 40 years in the context of 4.5B years of earths existence.  


The rate of change is extraordinary. This is climate change and the major global tipping points such as the melting of Alpine Glaziers, melting of Greenland Ice Sheets and the loss of the Coral Reef are happening and it may already be too late to reverse their impact. It is not clear what the global impact will be of these tipping points, i.e. we don't know what will happen and whether they set off a further warming and acceleration of extreme climate events.  


Can we wait for 2050 looking at the chart?  


We need to design in sustainability and innovation into our procurement function and we need to ensure UK Government uses all of its levers for change available to address climate change with urgency. One element of this is changing what we buy, how we buy the goods and services the public pay for and who we buy from within the public sector.

Let\'s put things in perspective:\n\n[Artical: 16 cruise liners create the same amount of pollution as ALL the worlds cars](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1229857/How-16-ships-create-pollution-cars-world.html#:~:text=The%20most%20staggering%20statistic%20of,fuel%20as%20small%20power%20stations.).\n\n[Image: More Data A](http://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/18351.jpeg).\n\n[Image: More Data B](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/styles/medium/private/images/2022-04/transportation-ghg-2022.png?itok=Rn49z1eg).\n\nIt\'s important to tackle this myth about pollution created by **car exhaust** because of the amount of road blockades our movement is involved in. This myth is peddled by an uneducated mainstream, along with big-oil funded propaganda, and used in fallacious ""hypocracy"" or ""gotcha"" arguments against climate activists. The term ""carbon footprint"" was coined by big oil company BP; as if Carbon (dioxide) is the only source of industrial pollution in the world. There are many many other types of pollutants.\n\nIt\'s also important we distinguish the difference between driving USED cars and encouraging production of more NEW cars. The industry and industrial practices around creating MORE/NEW cars certainly needs to be addressed as a major contributer of pollution. We have plenty of cars in the world right now, without building new (non electric) ones.

Isn\'t that a red flag for you?\n\nImage B doesn\'t have anything to do with this issue.  I wonder why you included it.\n\n---\n\nIn actual fact, shipping is around 2% of greenhouse gas emissions, but road is 12%, and almost half of that is passenger cars.\n\nSo passenger cars in total emit _three times_ as much CO2 as all shipping put together.\n\n----\n\n> There are many many other types of pollutants.\n\nGreenhouse gasses will, literally, destroy our ecosystem.

I am keen to invest in the training and equipment for the installation of heat pumps, which represent a major new market. I need a steady government regulatory environment, a clear commitment to legal binds that policy will not u-turn and undermine these investments, and a level playing field.\n\n\nI'm the owner of a land based business, providing nursery plants, fruit canes and trees. My business is under high stress due to the changing weather patterns of the climate, and hosepipe bans massively cutting into the size of sales in our busy period. I want the commitment to Net Zero to remain, and if possible accelerate. Otherwise my business is doomed.\n\nI'm the owner of solarpanel installation company. Government flipflops on paid-in-tariffs and DNO reluctance have repeatedly damaged consumer confidence, reducing installation rates to lower than they would be otherwise. With the current economic warfare under way across Europe, I am surprised the government has not called upon our skills to help protect the average British citizen.\n\nHello, I run a franchise food restaurant. We operate on thin margins, and staff overheads are our main concern. This is unaffected by Net Zero policy. We have seen a steady increase in the demand for less environmentally damaging menu options and we are happy to satisfy that market need. Government pressure to improve the accuracy and flexibility of the 30min energy markets would allow us to more carefully optimise energy use against anticipated demand (a fryer takes time to come up to heat). We would welcome stable policy in that area.\n\nAs a concerned citizen and manager of a carehome, I am deeply worried about the incidence of heatwaves and their impact on health services as well as my resident's quality of life. The building is an old Victorian one which has been converted to a nursing home, but further work is now needed to insulate it against summer heatwaves, work that directly reduces income while it is carried out, but will pay back over time in saved energy and continuity of customers.  A government backed insulation improvement scheme suitable for the care sector would be welcomed.\n\nI own and run a small garage, delivering MOTs, tyre replacements and keeping my community moving. The growth of SUVs has hurt my business though the physical space taken up on the forecourt reducing the number of customer's I can supply services to at once. Since repair and reconditioning for life enhancement is nearly always a massive energy saving over a (foreign) new build, my business helps work towards UK Net Zero. Recognition of this in terms of government carbon accounting and access to carbon trading schemes would be beneficial to us. Ensuring foreign companies must meet the Right to Repair regime instead of trying to lock uk SME out would also be beneficial to us, our customers, and the UK net zero goal.\n\nI am a student, looking at forming an industrial chemistry startup focused on delivering carbon sequestration through biochar, CCS and active mineralisation. The UK, with a temperate climate and secure rain levels, is capable of guaranteeing biomass growth in a changing climate that other countries will struggle to match. We have the chance to be world leaders in another critical piece of technology, as long as the regulatory environment does not allow that startup industry to wither with the lead lost to other developing countries ("", ""that's why we should respond with requests to go further faster, with buisness examples that are directly under threat from climate change.""]"

His approach in assessing how much impact per dollar can be achieved for different issues is very interesting, and seems like the *only* way we ought be making big financial decisions as a country.

For those of you that don’t know him, he basically advocates against massive spending towards climate change since that money would benefit humanity more in other places (curing malaria for example).

He also advocates against things like carbon taxes, that would increase gas prices and increase the cost of doing business(ie higher prices) since that hurts the poorest in our society.

He has also written a couple books relating to climate change and why the alarmism is unjustified. He also wrote a book called “The best way to spend $75 billion to make the world a better place” where he discusses alternate uses of capital and which use maximizes overall human good.

Frankly, I nor likely anyone in these comments has the resources to fact check everything he says, but it sure feels correct that spending money on climate change is misguided, given that there are much better uses of capital.

Terrible timing of the queens death,dooby-duby,74,x9yk0p,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/x9yk0p/terrible_timing_of_the_queens_death/,31,"
Does anyone else feel like the real tragedy of the queens death is not the personal loss of the monarch, who I have no reason to dislike, but the timing in relation to current political events

2 days ago, headlines focussed on Liz truss and her energy package, the most important political event since covid. Now, the package will conveniently avoid all scrutiny, overshadowed by the succession story.

Now was the time for workers to be angry. Angry at the lack of a windfall tax, placing the burden on the tax payer, and diverting crucial money away from green investment. Angry at the continued support given to energy companies, which are being allowed keep every penny of their unjust enrichment. Angry at the expansion of fracking, when green energy is the cheaper, safer and obvious direction for the country.

Liz truss is grateful. Rather than being painted as a wannabe thatcher in an era that doesn’t want or need her, she is simply the PM who meet the queen days before she died.

The queens death has United the nation. However, the nation needs to united against the government, not together in patriotism. 

Now is the worst time for a wave of patriotism. We should be challenging those in power to break from the old ways and put forward a radical vision, which accepts that we are now longer the great empire we once were. Instead, we are obsessing about the monarchy, a symbol of old Britain, a country that is gone, and which we are drowning by trying to save.

2/3 years down the line, with people starving and unable to heat themselves, this could have been a rather different rallying crying. It could have been a rally against the royals, symbols of luxury and extragence, unfit figures in a poverty stricken country. The arguments for abolishment would have been strong.

Yet now, on the brink of collapse, the queens death will have the opposite effect. It will divert peoples attention from there own avoidable demise. It will cancel necessary strikes. But most importantly it will steal headlines from truss’ incompetence, giving the government a much needed break.

Though there is no ‘good’ timing for the queens death, there is bad timing. All I hope is that people will not distracted for so long as to allow this government to fuck this country, quietly and slowly",1662737598.0,74,0,,"['Timing would have been worse if it was while Boris was PM and he was the one giving speeches.

My message to Extinction Rebellion,Rolapolabear,108,x88013,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/x88013/my_message_to_extinction_rebellion/,23,"First of all, I salute you for your bravery, daring, imagination, optimism and total refusal to accept domination.

I've seen and heard bland, unimaginative criticism of your movement. The one that most riles me is that you're stopping decent, respectable people from getting on with their lives. But what so many people, 'decent' or otherwise, fail to realize, is that those ordinary, 'respectable' lives, based on carbon combustion, are totally out of step with the planet's natural rhythm, and have been so for over two hundred years! When folks climb merrily into our cars, they think it's OK and natural, because everyone else does it. But it ain't, ain't, ain't!  Cars are poisonous, choking things, and our society's obsession with them is far from natural.

The sane ones are those who acknowledge the fact that fossil fuel economies must stop NOW, no matter what the cost. In challenging the establishment, the deeply entrenched interests of power elites who hold top government posts, XR are a voice of reason, a beacon of hope and a constant challenge to those who would continue to ride the wave of devastation that is being unleashed upon the world.

The law, as it stands, upholds the supposed rights of some deeply corrupt, self-serving individuals who claim a perfect right to devour the riches of the planet.

XR have even been called terrorists under another name, which is ludicrous. Terrorists are those who, in the name of their own bigoted and unfounded agenda, attempt through violence to impose their own worldview on others. The aims upheld by XR are solidly underpinned by science - the people who deny the devastating reality of climate change are the ones who are truly deluded; the real monsters are those who would sell the planet, and its millions upon millions of species, for short term gain.

In  recent days, political debate  has centred around the cost of living crisis, which is clearly a hugely important issue; the economy undeniably needs a boost too. But there seems to be an embargo on even raising the subject of climate change. It's as if politicians don't want the issue to be debated, or even recognised as a problem. They simply don't want people to know. Why? Because they and the corporate interests to which they're in thrall, would stand to lose too much.

I can't say I agree with absolutely everything that XR does and, indeed, there's room for healthy debate and disagreement  within any democratic process; and yet at other times, I've been deeply impressed with the energy, creativity and imagination that inspires its members. I've never forgotten those funky kangaroos in Westminster! Wahoooo!

Even as a kid, I saw cars rolling down the motorways like some obscene procession of shiny lemmings. I thought that if that was sanity I must be mad! So now I go around on my pushbike, just for the principle. I've always felt, deep inside, instinctively and intuitively, that what we're doing to this planet is fundamentally and profoundly wrong. Car exhaust fumes have to go somewhere. They don't just disappear or float off into the air like harmless fluffy clouds. Those 'decent', 'respectable' lives are anything but. We are not free to trash this planet as if we owned it.

You are the people who are pointing the way towards something better.

In their own days, the Suffragettes were criminalised and marginalised. History has been kinder to them, recognising that they were fighting for their rights.

You - we - are fighting for the very survival of life on this planet.",1662564366.0,108,0,,"['Thank you for your post /u/Rolapolabear. Your praise is welcomed.\n\nI want to take this opportunity, though, to address a misconception about the main sources of pollution in the world.\n\nWhile it\'s important to recognise the pollution created by broader fossil fuel economy, it\'s a myth/naive perspective to say that **driving/running a car\'s engine** (specifically) creates any substaintial amount of pollution.

This myth is peddled by an uneducated mainstream, along with big-oil funded propaganda, and used in fallacious ""hypocracy"" or ""gotcha"" arguments against climate activists.\n\nIt\'s also important we distinguish the difference between driving USED cars and encouraging production of more NEW cars. The industry and industrial practices around creating MORE/NEW cars certainly needs to be addressed as a major contributer of pollution. We have plenty of cars in the world right now, without building new (non electric) ones. We should be focusing our attention on industrial practises, electricity generation and govmental policy, not on individuals and their transport.', 'I just wish golf courses started getting targeted more.

Government policy should be the main focus of change. I chose the 'car' example because it is so salient, obvious and in my flamin' face.

So it's more of an emotional reaction of my own - also, there's something crazy, mindless and just barking about the amount of cars on the roads. But, yes, indeed, industry is a far worse culprit. Just not so obvious and in my face! Thank you for excellent articles.  Yes, indeed, cruise ships are a menace. Government policy is frightening, short-sighted and self-serving.

Creating a wider coalition and widening goals,Delyo00,8,x67f1c,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/x67f1c/creating_a_wider_coalition_and_widening_goals/,2,"The primary aim of XR, stopping the climate disaster, is a secondary aim of many other organisations. Often those organisations have existed for longer, have links to local organisers, media, activists, and are not afraid of direct action. Many of them don't view climate as the most important issue, but still recognise its importance. Majority of them are left wing political parties and smaller activist organisations. Some of their members already participate with us.

&#x200B;

I personally don't believe that our aim of protecting human civilisation from climate catastrophy is compatible with current economic system. Most of our members don't believe this either, I mean just look at this subreddit or go to a local meeting. Why is it then that no left wing agenda is on our actual program?

&#x200B;

It's the ruling class that make major decisions related to emissions, through corporations that they own, and as we know 70% of emissions are generated by top 100 companies. With ruling classes having so much power over the government, we have less of a chance to influence the lawmakers to make the right choices. Pleasing big corporations is most governments' main priority. Socialist, anarchist, communist, and the most mainstream, social democrat organisations are the ones in favour of holding the ruling class accountable, diminishing their power, or abolishing them altogether.

&#x200B;

I believe XR should build connections and work with those organisations, showing support at their events and reaching out for their advice, support, and participation in organising our own protests and direct actions to further our goals. In addition we must widen our program to include some of their policies. We must create a united front that demands climate justice and economic justice for all.

&#x200B;

From my own experience, the people who would be the most upset by this direction are not the people who are already protesting and risking being arrested on the street. Most of the people upset, already dislike us, are indifferent to us or are more well off individuals, that may potentially donate money to the cause but do not help build the movement.

&#x200B;

As my secondary point, I believe XR should add demands related to reorganising and increasing funding for research. Decrease in emissions should come both from getting rid off useless, destructive practices such as:

\- fossil fuel use

\- private jets

\- investment in car infrastructure vs public transport

\- meat consumption

\- unsustainable farming practices

\- build to fail practices

&#x200B;

But it also has to come from revolutionising existing, necessary practices:

\- new renewables and refining of existing ones

\- better batteries to support renewables

\- more efficient and less polluting industrial and agricultural processes

&#x200B;

For that we need more money for research and more money directed towards figuring out what are the best policy steps both for the climate and for humanity, as well as improving technology to serve those goals.",1662353847.0,8,0,,"['Literally, so many charities essentially have the same goal but they’re so disjointed. \n\nIf they all coordinated they would be a powerhouse. \n\nTo me it feels similar to how the left vote gets split into a bunch of smaller parties and their power gets diluted even though they are the majority. The right stays as one party so that’s why they always win. \n\nHow do we start that linking process?']"

And, again, sorry if you feel that I\'ve not heard you.', 'Before I list my points, I\'d just like to draw your attention to the fact that this ""impossible demand"" of asking politicians to set up citizens assemblies on climate change has already been achieved, most notably in France but there was a more limited citizens assembly for climate in the UK too. Also, the CEE bill, that includes a call for a ""climate and nature"" citizens assembly, has already got the support of 120 MPs...\n\nhttps://www.zerohour.uk/allies_and_supporters\n\nDo you doubt the CEE bill could pass?', ""Without systemic change, you can tinker at any edge you want.  It'll not make any difference, we're all still heading for the scorched planet. Capital doesn't care.  \n\n\nLook at the current state of UK politics. I don't think that that system is something we should encourage. And, for sure, no politician has ever made any positive change. That takes workers. That takes graft. That takes us to do stuff. We don't have to wait for a decree. See #7 and #6.   \n\n\nBut as an aside, what achievements did the French people's assembly win? And how was it structured? Who could vote or join the assembly?  How did people vote? What tech was involved?"", '> Who could vote or join the assembly?\n\nFrom this question alone I\'m assuming you\'re not familiar with how citizens assemblies work. Participants are selected via sortition, it\'s like how members of a jury are selected. One key difference with jury service is that members of a citizens assembly receive guidance from experts in the field to help inform their decisions, so they\'re not having to make difficult decisions without support.\n\nAs for what was achieved, for the climate ones not much, but citizens assemblies have proven influential on other issues, such as legalising abortion in Ireland, you can read about this here... https://involve.org.uk/resources/blog/opinion/citizens-assembly-behind-irish-abortion-referendum\n\nWith the previous citizens assembly on climate in the UK there was no requirement for the outcomes to matter, but that\'s different with the citizens assembly proposed in the CEE bill as it would require the Secretary of State to work with the citizens assembly members to come up with a new climate and ecology strategy.\n\nhttps://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2772\n\n""A Bill to require the Prime Minister to achieve climate and ecology objectives; to give the Secretary of State a duty to create and implement a strategy to achieve those objectives; to establish a Citizens’ Assembly to work with the Secretary of State in creating that strategy; to give duties to the Committee on Climate Change regarding the objectives and strategy; and for connected purposes.""', 'Right, the Irish example is a good tinkering start, but it\'s legacy thinking. I mean, the tech has gone way beyond that crap now. The thinking of folks have yet to catch up, it would seem.   \n\n\n"" However, once the public had had a chance to consider the matter more deeply during the referendum campaign, the results were strikingly similar to that of the Assembly. In the Assembly 64% voted in favour of “terminations without restrictions”. In the referendum, 66.4% voted in favour of repealing the eighth amendment, effectively legalising abortion in Ireland.""  \n\n\nSo the steps taken were:  \n\n\n1. Create an assembly \n2. Get it to decided on a topic\n3. Present that to the MPs who debated if it should be put to the public\n4. Put it to the public via a ref\n\nExcept, the public agreed with the assembly. So, what\'s with steps 1,2,3 and 4? They are a waste of time. \n\nA new voting system allow us to do away with all of these hot air sessions and have a reactive vote. Still with all the evidence. Still with all the due diligence. \n\nIn fact, just like getting the builders in to do a job, we can just appoint these ""professionals"" as the custodians of these matters. With instant recall. We do away with the class of politicians completely.   \n\n\nWhat the Irish example shows is that engaging humans in questions, is a good thing. Yet, it also shows legacy thinking in terms of the process. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink of all those human hours lost to needless debate in the MP place. Why was it even put to the MPs?  \n\n\n""The Assembly’s recommendations were presented to the Oireachtas, Ireland’s parliament, by the Joint Committee on the Eight Amendment. This was done via the Committee’s report on the findings of the Assembly, published at the end of 2017. The report was debated in parliament in early 2018. It was quickly followed by the Eighth Amendment Referendum Bill which paved the way for last week’s referendum.""  \n\n\nThat shows that the humans involved were still thinking that they are subservient to the MPs. That shows that the humans didn\'t understand that they are the power.   \n\n\nWhat if the MPs had said ""no""? That is in their right. That is how they normally roll.  I mean, look at going to war. There were many marches against it, but the MPs still went.   \n\n\nSo, keeping a politician in the loop, or creating an assembly, is a bit of a waste of time.  Or a complete waste of time, in 2022. I mean, we\'ve the tech now.   \n\n\nWe use it all the time. From reality TV shows to whatever.   \n\n\n""Vote now for your winner. Voting opens now, and closes at 2230"".   \n\n\nSo, this idea of ""we need to ask MPs"", whilst the Irish got lucky and the MPs went for it....I don\'t share you faith that every MP would act the same. Especially not in the UK.  \n\n\nAnd as for the other stuff. There have been no wins on the climate, as such.\n\nThis is the most worrying part:  \n\n\n""""A Bill to require the Prime Minister to achieve climate and ecology objectives; to give the Secretary of State a duty to create and implement a strategy to achieve those objectives; to establish a Citizens’ Assembly to work with the Secretary of State in creating that strategy; to give duties to the Committee on Climate Change regarding the objectives and strategy; and for connected purposes.""""  \n\n\nBecause it raises the question: Why are they not doing that just now?', '> Still with all the evidence. Still with all the due diligence. \n\nHow are you going to ensure this in a direct democracy system? This has historically been one of the main weaknesses of direct democracy. You can\'t fix this with tech alone as even if you make the information available it doesn\'t mean people have the time or energy to read it, and even if they do read it you have limited chance to check that they understood it, especially in highly subjective matters when there is a less clear ""right"" answer.']"

The extreme weather events all parts of the world are experiencing are rapidly becoming more severe, are happening with increasing frequency and becoming more disruptive.  The climate change we are currently experiencing will only become more challenging over the coming years and our actions today will not reverse this short-term prognosis but will have a positive impact in the decades to come, but only if we take positive and affirmative action now.  It is therefore incumbent on the UK Government to use every possible lever to positively impact the environment and limit the negative impact of climate change.\n\nThe Procurement Bill 2022 is a once in a generation opportunity to embed a legal obligation on all public bodies to spend taxpayers’ money in such a way as to positively impact the environment.  The current Procurement Bill 2022, and the proposed approach to address environmental considerations in procurement via policy considerations is insufficiently robust.  A legal obligation will ensure that all Public Sector procurement and related expenditure will need to design in environmental considerations as a core requirement and that all suppliers into UK Government are contractually obligated to take positive action with regards to the environment.\n\nUK Government’s stated intent of being a global leader on climate change means that it is not a credible position that taxpayers’ money, public sector procurement and therefore public spend is not being used to impact the environment systemically and positively and that there is a clear legal obligation to do so.\n\nIn simple terms the aim of this Government and Parliamentary petition is to ensure:  \nAll procurement and public sector expenditure should be undertaken with the intent of having a positive impact on the environment and this should be enshrined within the Procurement Bill 2022.\n\nFor this to be successful we need a minimum of 10,000 people to support the petition, and 100,000 supporters for this to be formally debated in Parliament.

UK beachgoers are\xa0more likely to spot one\xa0now than in the past, as rising sea temperatures due to climate change have ushered more of these gelatinous animals into the waters around northern Europe.\n\n>Jellyfish don’t swim like fish. They belong to the plankton: a diverse group of marine creatures that drift through the sea, floating wherever the currents take them. Jellyfish are among the few types of plankton visible to the human eye. Most plankton are tiny (smaller than 2mm) and can only be seen with a microscope.\n\n>Although largely invisible, plankton are the base of the ocean food web, eaten by fish, seabirds and even whales. Species that don’t eat plankton, like seals, will eat organisms that do. Globally, phytoplankton (single-celled algae which, like trees and shrubs on land, are mostly green in colour and use chlorophyll to photosynthesise)\xa0produce half of the oxygen\xa0we breathe.\n\n>Increasingly abundant jellyfish are just one example of the many ways that plankton are reflecting climate change’s influence on the ocean. My research team has found that the species making up North Atlantic plankton communities are also\xa0shifting as sea temperatures rise.\n\n>We analysed\xa0plankton data\xa0collected using nets and bottles throughout the northeast Atlantic over the past 80 years.\xa0We found\xa0that the larvae of crabs, starfish, sea urchins and lobsters are becoming more common, while shrimp-like crustaceans called copepods (a critical food source for fish, seabirds and even basking sharks) are declining.\n\n>These are big changes among some of the smallest forms of life, and they will affect the entire marine food web, as well as humans. We must understand these changes in order to adapt to them. That could mean new fishing practices – and even diets.\n\n**In a jellyfish’s wake**\n\n>Zooplankton (the animal subset of plankton) consists not only of copepods and jellyfish, but also the larval stages of fish, crustaceans and echinoderms (the “spiny skin” group that starfish and sea urchins belong to) which later settle to the sea floor and mature into their familiar adult forms. Both zooplankton and phytoplankton communities are highly diverse, containing species of all sorts of weird and wonderful shapes.\n\n>Since the 1960s, colder-water zooplankton species have been\xa0retreating\xa0towards the Arctic, followed by warmer-water species that are also tracking rising sea temperatures northwards. The warmer-water zooplankton species which now dominate northern European waters are generally smaller and less nutritious than the cold-water species they have replaced.\n\n>The seasonal timing of when plankton are abundant in the North Sea has also\xa0shifted, including around the UK. While the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton is driven by sunlight and so hasn’t changed, the point in the year when some zooplankton species are most abundant now arrives earlier, as shorter and warmer winters cause the eggs of some species to hatch sooner. This has meant a mismatch between the spring phytoplankton bloom and the annual peak abundance of the zooplankton that gorge on it.\n\n>These shifts have meant the quantity and type of food available to larval fish (which are zooplankton themselves but eat smaller zooplankton) is changing in the North Atlantic. Warm-water species such as bluefin tuna and anchovies are now\xa0commonly found\xa0in northern European waters, while cod, herring, whiting and sprat, all important commercial fish species, have declined in number.\n\n>Fishery managers need to work with scientists to set quotas that ensure these new species are fished sustainably, while coastal fishing communities may have to catch new species as familiar ones decline. The public may have to adapt their diets too as traditional species, such as cod in the UK, become scarcer.\n\n>The jellyfish you now see in UK waters might have once been a rarity, but it’s following a (largely invisible) crowd that is upending marine food webs and changing the kind of fish you might buy and eat locally. The next time you watch the hypnotic motion of one of these beautiful creatures as it pulses through the water, think of the changes its arrival portends, both for the ocean and yourself.\n\n*Author- Abigail McQuatters-Gollop*']"

There is an XR branded Telegram channel that continues to post fake-news and denialist pseudo-science,Bioplasia42,69,wuv8gq,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/wuv8gq/there_is_an_xr_branded_telegram_channel_that/,12,"Hi all, I am posting here because I don't know where else to go. The title is a TL;DR of what's up.

There is an XR Telegram channel with 2.5k members that has been around for ~3 years and is the first thing to pop up if you look for XR on Telegram, as it has the matching chat handle. The admins of that channel and connected group continue to share unscientific posts that directly attack science and efforts surrounding climate change. I would wager that two of the admins are basically qanon people.

The quality of the channel varies between passable at best and outright damaging at worst. Past attempts to address this in chat have lead to admins deflecting to the ""all angles have to be considered"", ""science/academia is sponsored by Soros"" type of arguments as well as even more bizarre deflections, one of those being ""we can't have conflict in this group because it hurts severely disabled people"".

I have seen users being called shill for arguing for renewables, tech solutions and basically everything that isn't ""let's just start living in dirt huts again.""

The last few days this has been escalating, with posts like [this one stating scientists agree that there is no climate emergency](https://i.imgur.com/jlS61TG.png) - the only source for which is a sketchy website with zero substantive content, and [the newest one stating CO2 isn't a GHG](https://i.imgur.com/49phI0C.png).

It bothers me that this is the first thing people see that might genuinely be interested in making a difference, and that these people misuse the XR name to this degree.

I don't know what to do about it, as past attempts at talking to the admins have lead to nothing. Reporting is all I can think of, but maybe if enough people complain they will remove their XR affiliation at least.

The channel is literally @eXtinctionRebellion. I won't link it for obvious reasons.

Any help would be appreciated.",1661178761.0,69,0,,"["">maybe if enough people complain they will remove their XR affiliation at least.\n\nDon't hold your breath."", ""I wonder if it would be somehow possible to let people in that channel know that things are sketchy there, without getting immediately banned. Like if we'd all join and start talking shit we'd just get kicked out, but would there be ways to do that in a non-violent way that lets us be there and provide context and nuance to sketchy articles?"", 'There are probably more denialist groups on the web than there are factual. Nothing you can do about it, they are super entrenched in anything but the hard truth because they don’t really care and don’t like being told how to live. If governments were to take action, it would be dubbed as part of the new world order.', ""I think ask XR to email everyone who's registered with XR, across all countries with an XR presence, about the fake Telegram channel."", 'Just one?', 'Who uses ""Telegram"" ? Does anyone who has any influence over this world use ""Telegram""? What is it ?', ""I just dislike the idea of just looking the other way. That's why we're here, right?

Aside from that, nuclear power has its role to play, but renewables like wind and solar are cheaper and quicker to bring online, both of which are big advantages.

But I'm so scared of going to jail. What if I get abused behind bars? What if the police are harassing me? 

I wish there was another way I could get people to listen without making that big sacrifice. I wish so badly it hurts.",1660991070.0,16,0,,"[""This advice depends entirely on which country you are in and how your local population and police respond to protests. Do not put yourself in danger. If activists are threatened in your area, your thoughts can be read for you at XR actions in safer countries. Sometimes your words can be read or photographs displayed outside your countries embassy. Meaningful action could come through many uses of your talents and all are appreciated. Civil disobedince may not be your best option - only you can decide that.\n\nIf it is safe to do so, speak to your local Extinction Rebellion group. (Or if you are in the UK go to London in September). Many other groups exist - find one/start one.\n\nAssuming you are in a safe country, you can protest without breaking the law, being arrested or going to jail. Most protestors are not going to get arrested.\n\nIn the UK the police will give you several warnings and opportunities to move away. You can change your mind and move away from any action at any time. (At one event this week I left my placard with a security guard whilst I entered his building to use the toilet. He stood holding my placard whilst I went off-duty.)\n\nActivists do not block any site or glue themselves to infrastructure at random. Weeks of research and practice goes into these actions, a support team of around eight people per arrestee are available to provide for physical and emotional needs and legal advice. Actions without planning and support are reckless and unwelcome, do not do them.\n\nThere are roles for artists and engineers, health providers, logistics support, cleaners and cooks, carers and advisors and a million other thing that may use your talents. You will only get arrested if you choose to.\n\nIf you choose to try a protest and have been unable to make contact with a local group, take a friend, stay with people you trust. You will find XR people mostly open and willing to talk to you after some reasonable caution. Don't do or be led into anything reckless. Conceal flags, placards etc when you leave a protest, stay in public areas and beware of bad actors. Don't go home alone. Always take food, drink. personal meds and suitable clothing. Don't drink or do drugs around an action, this is not the time.\n\nMostly a protest is hanging out with friends, waving flags, singing and chanting. Save anything more planned for another day.\n\nXR - Doing good in ridiculous ways."", ""The role you play is your choice. You don't have to get arrested, if you don't want. \n\nI have been arrested once during an XR action, nearly 3 years ago in London. I took my food trailer down and we parked it up on the pavement by Westminster Abbey, I was arrested for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. Ultimately no further action was taken and eventually I got my trailer back, although the Met Police had completely trashed it inside.\n\nOn another occasion I provided the sustenance for a coal mine protest, 1300 vegan meals over 4 days. The coal mine is now closed. I chose a non-spicy role that time, and suffered no consequences apart from contracting covid.\n\nDo what feels right for you."", ""Wishing is what got us into this situation. \n\nI'm not going to tell you that without your personal involvement in civil disobedience, the revolution will fail. It's simply not true, more for systemic reasons than anything else. However, I will tell you what many here probably won't: you absolutely should do it. \n\nNot to save the world — to prove to yourself that reality is never as scary as we make it out to be and to realize the courage of your convictions. Where we're headed, a time will definitely come when you realize things have gone too far; the moral line you drew in the sand, maybe without even realizing it, has undeniably been crossed and the cognitive dissonance cannot be resolved. In that moment, you'll either be prepared to do whatever is necessary to live with yourself — or you won't.\n\nWhether you shrink in the face of adversity comes down to practice. People aren't born courageous or cowardly, they work at it over the course of many years, more often out of necessity than desire. So, start working at being courageous.\n\nFind a local XR group or some related CD organization. Start by volunteering for a relatively low-risk role, then escalate. Push your comfort zone and it will expand; allow it to stay in one place and it will harden into a cage that prevents your growth.\n\nThis isn't about getting people to listen. It's not about other people at all — setting up that dichotomy is not useful. This is about the sort of person *you* want to be in this world. With sufficient time, attention, discipline, and grit, you can become any sort of person you want. Clearly, there is little time, and nothing left to lose, so you might as well start transforming yourself today."", ""You are smart to avoid jail.  Besides, blocking roads, interrupting traffic, and gluing hands don't actually stabilize climate."", 'In the USA: Do it a group, but not before you\'ve had meetings that agree on tactics, arrange publicity-- press release, publicity representative, etc., and most importantly, raise funds for attorneys and bail. Move fast, because you will be infiltrated (learn about poison pen/snitch jacketing/""flickering light"").', ""There are surreptitious forms of civil disobedience that do not rely on public spectacle, in which case you'll only go to jail if you get caught. In a country like mine where you get tear gassed, abducted, and/or executed in the street, protests are worthless. Aim to make it physically impossible for so and so to continue destroying the environment. Learn efficient methods of sabotaging various systems, machinery, buildings, etc."", ""The Egytian police found, during the Arab spring that if they chased away the street food sellers that protestors drifted away in the evening instead of ramping the protest up under the cover of darkness. Protesting burns calories and hungry people go home for dinner if nothing else is available. I guess this has been noted by police around the world.\n\nThank you for your work. Providing food is an important service, is greatly appreciated and keeps protestors moral up. Sometimes my blood sugar will plummet and I get shakey and weak so I always carry snack bars and water. It's interesting to be aware of police attention as I ignore the protest and root about in my bag for a snack bar.\n\nI hope to be your customer in September."", 'I am sorry, but I don’t have the strength to do those kinds of things. I have autism and it is very hard for me to keep up with things for so long. If I go to jail I will have a heart attack that may put me in the hospital. I will risk getting killed by a cell mate. If being part of this protest means having to sacrifice my well-being and my health and my sanity then I can’t do it,  Not on those terms', ""I won't be there this time, waiting on some surgery.\n\nYes, sustenance underpins everything. Cannot protest on an empty belly, especially in the sleet and snow!\nFor the Dead Canaries protest at Pont Valley I had my kitchen set up in an old church, which also doubled as accommodation. Up about 5am to get the hundred plus litres of porridge on the go, then lunch cooked to take to the protest and dinner ready for 7pm or so. It really was awesome.\n\nNobody goes hungry at the Extinction Kitchen!\n\nIt was pretty crazy in London, the infrastructure we got in place allowed us to hold the site until the wednesday night, there were even people camping on top of the trailer. Fed countless folk, but it wasn't just me. I was merely part of something."", ""Then don't take part in civil disobedience. There's always a risk. There's plenty of mass protest you can go to where you're perfectly safe, especially if you just march with your banner and remain peaceful and obedient to the police."", ""You *do* have the strength, that's my entire point. Maybe not right this minute, but nobody transforms overnight. At the end of the day, you can place whatever limitations on yourself that you want. You can contribute however you want. It's your life, after all.\n\nI really do hope, for your own sake, that you test your limitations. I spent many years medicated for psychological disorders that I believed were an inescapable part of me, only to discover that was never true. I had to realize that through action, though — there's nothing to wish for.\n\nIf you stick to wishing circumstances were different — that you were different — that's fine, too. It's just another way to live."", 'Thank you for taking care of us. I hope the surgery goes as well as it can and that you are fit for the next one.\n\nI get extremely worried about some of our younger rebels. They think they are indestructable - until they find they are not.', ""I've seen, and consoled some distraught kids, if I dare call them that. I'm 53 in about a week, tough as an old dog.

Also people tend to forget that the main traffic on a train line is actually freight.

Firstly, such destruction to nature cannot be reversed at all, what is lost cannot be made again. Secondly, the requirements for offsetting and checks do not necessarily lead to any outcome beneficial to nature and are simply acts of greenwashing, which has the purpose of tricking people.\n\nEdit: Oh, and even from a non-eco point of view it's a complete waste of money. They are spending a *huge* amount to shave a few minutes off of travel time for a few people who work in the city that could be put to vastly better use."", ""I've been thinking about this myself. More rail access is good, but rail travel along the HS2 line is already possible, so improving existing lines should really be a priority. Also, as others have said, it's really hard to 'offset' the destruction of old woods. They have mycorrhizae in the soil that can't be so easily replaced, just to give one reason"", 'I used to be strongly against HS2. (Well actually originally I was Slightly For). I’m now Strongly For HS2.   \n\nYes it causes environmental damage locally, but far far far less than a road of the same capacity does, its better than any other transport method efficiency wise in operation too. The damage to woodlands is overblown, some of the woodlands it’s claimed will be affected (due to being within a certain distance of the line) are the other side of a motorway to the line. Their mitigation efforts, with tree planting, and soil-relocation too, are fairly impressive even if they don’t really make up for the historical, cultural and ecological benefits of ancient woodlands, they’re trying and in 100 years the benefits will mostly be back in those new woodlands.   \n\nThe speed is a useful benefit. How it should be presented is a capacity argument. The West Coast mainline is one of the busiest train lines in Europe, and at the moment it tries to mix fast non-stopping services going long distance, with local commuting services, with freight traffic. Mixing all these different types of train services on one line (even quad track ones) is extremely difficult. Removing all the fast long-distance trains onto a new dedicated line adds a lot of capacity for long distance travel, and local stopping services and freight. By separating traffic you add more capacity than just an additional line would suggest.  \n\nThe high speed nature makes it more competitive and attractive to passengers compared to air travel. Italy has built such an effective high speed rail network that their national airline went bankrupt. France is trying to block domestic flights. And some of the aspects that make it an intensive high-carbon railway to build (such as modular concrete tracks, where the sleepers are joined together in sections rather than being individual concrete sleepers) both reduce carbon emissions overall (because maintenance on that track bed system is very reduced) but also make the track more resilient to climate change (because that track system basically prevents rail buckling in high temperatures). 90% of the phase 1 route is in tunnels, viaducts or bridges, which make it more carbon intensive to build again, but tunnels especially and viaducts and bridges to some degree also are the items that reduce the local environmental impact.   \n\nPeople want to travel, people should be able to travel, we aren’t ever going to convince them to choose trains, which are the most environmentally friendly way to travel, unless we provide them with comfortable, fast, not-over-crowded, reasonably affordable train travel.  Building HS2 is the most benefit for cost way to do that to the UK’s rail network at the moment.  \n\nBuild it, build it in full, build it with all the options for capacity and capability upgrades that were initially intended, then go on to Northern Powerhouse Rail and whatever form HS3 takes after that.', 'HS2 is absolutely not ‘carbon free’. Nothing is. The rail line is cutting through ancient woodlands. And those cannot be replaced - old woods have an incredible diversity of species present and these are lost when the woods are cut down. You can’t replant ancient woodland. Yes, we need to modernise our railways but a new rail line is a vanity project.', ""Good idea but poor execution. I'm not convinced about the route and dislike the land grabbing. Also can we reinstate local lines and stations on the existing network.\n\nIt will never be carbon free. You cannot reinstate ancient woodland. It is heavily greenwashed."", 'For decades environmentalists have been saying that cars are bad, planes are worse and we should cycle or use public transport, and I agree with them.\n\n\nNow the greens are vehemently protesting against building a new rail line between the countries biggest cities. \n\n \nThis utter lack of consistency undermines the credibility of green politics.', 'By having HS2 you make more room on the west coast mainline for local and freight trains which will take cars and lorries off of the road.', 'Yeah I guess you are right. It is quite a waste of money, since they are using so much of it. I just feel like the old forests that are very sadly being cut down is not much when considering the very low emissions from operating the train in the future. Why is this particular project so much worse than all the other similar ones.', ""> Oh, and even from a non-eco point of view it's a complete waste of money. They are spending a *huge* amount to shave a few minutes off of travel time for a few people who work in the city that could be put to vastly better use.\n\nThis is a colossal strawman. HS2 is an attempt to add significant capacity to the rail network, and to free up space for regional trains by taking intercity trains onto a different line.

Check out [bikepacking.com](https://bikepacking.com/) and [MTBR forums](https://www.mtbr.com/forums/).

If you don’t have a bike, look for an entry-level model with a spread of decent components. You’ll figure out what you like and don’t like with your first setup, and then you can invest in exactly what you really want to upgrade. The market is opening up a little after systemic COVID-related delays. \n\nSide note: I think the term *mountain biking* actually came from one of the earliest bicycles “invented” for dedicated off-road terrain in the 50s or 60s, called The Mountain Bike.\n\n(Edited for formatting)', ""Mate, everyone starts out shit.

Also it\'s easy to find online stores for games on www.boardgameoracle.com. Alternatively you can try to find a physical board game store near you and save the shipping.\n\nRegarding looking for gaming groups, that usually happens in Facebook groups separate from the 2nd hand selling. Try and search for your town and ""board games"" there might be one. Most open groups are generally found on www.meetup.com though or if you are lucky to have a board game café or store nearby they often have a day each week where people come and play with anyone else showing up. There are generally so many games available that it is basically expected to explain the rules, so don\'t worry about not knowing any when you go.\n\nAlright, here\'s some suggestions to check out in the genres you mention:\n\nStory driven RPG\'s are actually a huge genre in board games too. Many come out all the time often with a ton of plastic miniatures which can be warranted if one plays the game a ton, but for most it\'s probably not reasonable. Some examples are **Tainted Grail** and **Gloomhaven** (currently ranked #1) which has a very reasonably priced \'beginner\' box called **Jaws of the Lion** where the first 5 scenarios slowly teach you the rules. Can personally strongly recommend this. There\'s actually a legit game called **Fallout: Wasteland Warfare**, which supports solo play and has decent ratings but I have not tried this myself.\n\nRegarding FPS I don\'t have personal experience with many, but know that **Adrenaline** catches the franticness of Quake well. But something like **Unmatched**  or **Dice Throne** which both have many different editions might give a similar feel.\n\nFor driving games there are some time-tested classics like **Formula D** or the newer (and simpler) **Downforce**. A related one that might or might no be interesting to you is **Flamme Rouge** about bike racing, but it really simulates the strategies of racing well. If you\'re ready for a more Mad Max-like experience then the soon-to-be-released game **Thunder Road: Vendetta** might be worth checking out.\n\nHorror games can\'t really do jump scares in board games, since you do all the manipulation, so no worries. But it can still recreate some sense of urgency and dread. A few examples from the top games are **Mansion of Madness: Second Edition** where you (together) try to escape a house full of Cthulu-esque horror, but this one requires a companion app. Another suggestion is the recent game **Nemesis** which basically is the Alien movie in a box. And your friends might decide to abandon you to save their skin in the last minute ;)\n\nHope something sparked your interest, otherwise try and surf a little on the top 100 of the boardgamegeek website or some of the youtube people posting there. A word of warning, given the subreddit we are in, that it can be very easy for newcomers to this hobby to go out and buy everything slightly recommended before knowing their taste well. So, I can strongly recommend only getting a few yourself and try to play other games that people already own. As an added bonus you don\'t have to read the rules yourself :P', 'It’s a fair concern tho', ""How do you quantify that? gardening in itself isn't a sustainable practice."", 'I definitely agree with this, mainly I meant ""using resources on something thats not a necessity"".

list of demands to save us for extinction,jakeybojangles,18,w8mgrw,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/w8mgrw/list_of_demands_to_save_us_for_extinction/,8,"I believe in the science, facts and the general consensus that climate change is the biggest problem facing humanity.

Free societies can solve this problem and more problems in many ways.

1- stop ecocicde - make it a crime punishable by extreme taxes n sanctions ensuring that it isn't profitable anymore
 by taking out and enforcing environment impact assessments.
 
2- start the renewable sustainable green global revolution ( USA Russia had a space race for fun, in this modern day the world should be having a renewable race for the best alternative use of power, energy, products and packaging that doesn't destroy our planet but instead works with the ecosystem and our shared environment. Done not by competing against each other but through collaboration with the greatest minds of our generation across the entire planet - to help acquire more great minds obviously we need free educational n medical facilities for poorer nations will be essential to bring out the Einstein's of the world so we can get cooking on some great ideas)

So tax and sanctions on everyone who commits ecocicde and drastically raise the funding of renewable sustainable sources of green power and energy, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and as much green infrastructure as humanly possible. G.i will help physical and mental health while dealing with this crisis on the front lines of life. 
Fund ecological beneficial agricultural practices and stop funding ecologically destructive agriculture practices. 

Reward ecologically beneficial practices while sanctions ecocidal practices 

3. Give the people 'credit' to play with. So a universal basic income which can only be used for carbon neutral or negative things, shops, products, services and amenities. Products i.e sustainable carbon neutral or negative items, clothes etc.. services i.e renewable energy bills, insulation and renewable energy power sources installed for homeowners and a renters schemes for the people who have slumlord land owners not able or willing to attach solar panels. Credit to spend on local small businesses with great sustainable renewable and green ideas.

All plant based food options for human consumption to be funded to make it as affordable and cheaper as the animal agricultural industry. Factory farmed Animal agricultural industry to stop being funded, ecologically humanely raised animal agricultural industry to be funded instead.

4. Free green transport + energy producing roads while driving on them.( Long shot to have these roads right now but with the eco climate crisis race affordable and excellent long lasting designs will be developed)

5. White collar crime - to be actually criminalised and tax evasion to be taken serious, tax offshore safe havens to be criminalised, to stop the ultra rich from pillaging our country and keeping their hoard of wealth hiding while raising prices and creating Inflation to keep profiting and keep stealing money from the people.

Political crimes to be punishable by prison sentences and heavy fines.

6. 4 day 4 hour work weeks to allow for us to have free time to either explore avenues of bettering the world and educating ourselves as well as to have some well deserved time to rest and recuperate and obviously enjoy this banging summers we're having now. Nae need to go to Tenerife when ya live in Costa del Scotland!

7. Local government funding increase to create a better sense of community. To allow for community members to help improve and update our outdated and underfunded villages, towns and cities who struggle to get citizens input on planning decisions. Localise the issue to get community gardens, fridges and much more things the general public desire by getting citizen participation in decision making.

8. Reuse, up cycle, recycle all waste. Ones man's rubbish is another's treasure. Wise up to the potential in our rubbish and use it instead of landfilling or shipping to another country to deal with.


Im sure there are many other ways and would love to hear some ideas from some people as this is the begining of the list of global demands that will hopefully help ensure everyone and thing on this planet doesn't fucking die in a fire lol.",1658848772.0,18,0,,"['Written after the main body: Think of all this as just food for thought. A lot of what I\'m trying to get across is that there is no way to have any of these changes implemented without a revolution. Like, 1917-style revolution. The state is run *by* and *for* the ruling class. There was literally what some conceive of as a second civil war in the US in I think the 1870\'s called the Railroad Wars. Hundreds of thousands of workers against the American state trying to get any rights whatsoever. There were more ""labour wars"" in the early 20th century broadly called the Coal Wars. These were also fought against private armies like the Pinkertons as well as the US National Guard. People killed and died so their children didn\'t have to get black lung and so they could be paid in money instead of scrip. This is what is took to get *small concessions that slightly reduced profits in one nation*. Consider what will be necessary to end production-for-profit completely, globally. Your points, while I criticize many as liberal and sort of \'capitalist-realist\' are mostly pretty good and all in all *would* yield a better world, but you asked for me to comment and so I have:\n\n* What power could a hypothetical citizens assembly wield against a ruling class that doesn\'t want to play ball? Because this is the situation we find ourselves in. As an example: Beyond a supermajority of Americans want a non-transformative change that\'s already proven to work all around the world -healthcare- and yet it hasn\'t been brought about.\n\n* How would one prevent this citizens assembly from being killed or imprisoned for trying to change things? Groups like XR aren\'t really faced with much state oppression because they don\'t pose any threat to making actual changes. If there was a body such as you allude to that could actually make demands of the bourgeois state, they would be in extreme danger. In non-\'Western\' countries where the appearance of a ""free society"" doesn\'t need to be kept up, even relatively innocuous climate activists are routinely murdered.\n\n* What do you mean by free society? Almost every state that isn\'t a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is faced with total economic and military encirclement so they aren\'t free to act as they deem necessary, and every other state is a DoB where the working class is subject to the will and interests of the owning class.\n\n1- What would constitute ecocide? Would historically and contemporary over-exploited countries and peoples be exempt from restrictions on resource extraction or growth, or alternatively would the nations that colonized the world be required to pay reparations in money, labour, technology, or some other form? \n\nTaxes aren\'t necessary to fund government spending in countries with currency sovereignty. Such countries are the ones that need to change first and most. Taxes on individuals in these nations aren\'t for raising money, but for adjusting money supply and demand to control inflation among other things. Taxes on corporations to control their behaviour can just be dodged or passed on. You have a point addressing this later. I will address it further there.\n\nSanctions are basically ""war crimes"", they only impose suffering on the most vulnerable in a society. Those least responsible for and able to change conditions that lead to the imposition of sanctions. They should never be imposed.\n\nIt will always be profitable to extract resources from the earth so long as capitalist relations are maintained.\n\nEnvironmental impact assessments are performed for resource extraction projects already, they\'re just ignored.\n\n2- The USA and the USSR (Not Russia. Russia was one SSR out of many) didn\'t have a space race for fun. The USSR was doing it and the USA couldn\'t let them have such good publicity or what they perceived to be such a strategic military advantage. While you\'re right that collaboration should be pursued rather than competition, it should be said that we have all the technologies we need to implement the massive shift needed. It\'s just not as profitable to make the switch when you can just do both and make more money. A fundamental switch away from production for exchange value to production for use value must be implemented. e.g. it doesn\'t matter if the packaging for one\'s treats are compostable and made in an ""eco friendly"" way if during the production process the components and finished product are still making multiple globe-spanning trips to take advantage of wage inequality and colonial market exploitation. Less needs to be produced and in ways that are structurally -not just technologically- more *energy* efficient rather than *money* efficient.\n\nWhile it would be good for so many in terms of quality of life, and I\'m critically for it, UBI wouldn\'t address the relations of production that keep power out of the hands of the people and in the hands of those who profit from burning the earth.\nIf landlords didn\'t exist, there wouldn\'t be people who have an interest in *not* fixing up/upgrading residences. Small businesses are on the whole (there are many exceptions) just inefficient large businesses. They\'re not superior morally or in terms of energy wastage to their giant counterparts.\n\nYeah, it sure would be nice if animal production were stopped. Alas. Too profitable.\n\nWhite collar crime is already illegal. It just isn\'t really prosecuted since we live in states run by and for capital, the bourgeoisie. China, for example, executes capitalists that step out of line regularly. I\'m not exactly for the death penalty but I\'ll be damned if it isn\'t a lot nicer to see than them just freely exploiting people and the earth. Less violence overall. Unequal development and economic colonialism through institutes of financial and military coercion like NATO, the UN, and the IMF also help to enable these behaviours.\n\nA 4 day 4 hour work week with no pay loss (after large pay increases, mind you) would be great. It would also help towards reducing production to economically sustainable levels.\n\nI know you\'re joking but as the climate crisis worsens, the gulf stream that keeps the northern parts of Europe from being like Siberia is looking like it\'ll collapse, leaving a lot of people in the tundra.\n\nChanging the structure of local governments would be an extremely effective way to promote all of the changes necessary to ""save the world"". Municipalities typically can\'t be conceived of as having \'currency sovereignty\' and are almost never legally allowed to run deficits, so taxes at this scale actually mean something concrete. Abolishing property taxes and instead implementing wealth taxes would be a great way to increase civic funding while taking the load off of people who don\'t have as much to spare. Sadly municipal govts are typically extremely limited by the larger government bodies they\'re subject to with regards to what they\'re allowed to enact or change. For example: Where I am, cities aren\'t allowed to change their voting structure. It\'s first past the post or else. They also can\'t implement wealth taxes. They can\'t do shit, really. We can\'t change the law that makes community fridges illegal.\n\nRRR, hell yeah. Recycling, though, is yet another example of how the profit motive prevents anything good from happening. Most materials could be recycled or at least changed forms to be usable in a different way, but it\'s not profitable to pay people or create/implement tech to sort everything as specifically as would be necessary, nor is pre-used material typically cheap enough to make it worth using vs new material for firms. It should be, but laws are written by capitalists to ensure profit and the imperial subjugation of the global south also ensures access to very cheap new materials.', 'On the link below are Extinction Rebellions agreed and published list of demands.

So it’s a huge obstacle in terms of public opinion. \n\nAnyways, we need a steady state economy. \n\nFrom an energy standpoint and resources, we just have to be able to replace what we use. The more people we have, the harder that is. But to the point, we just need to make and use things that can be repaired, replaced and that last.', 'We are not going carbon zero without being forced by the collapse of civilization, which we are witnessing now. Our lands are burning, rivers running dry, facing severe droughts or floods and yet the only agenda in politics is to burn more fossil fuels. A returning opium, fascism, is growing, providing false hope, simple answers, and giving righteousness to hate. On the other side, well meaning people are stuck hoping for wonder technologies (green energy is a lie) and the simplification in the human psyche - ""if 8 billion people can only...!"". We all know how that turns out.\n\nMany ecological tipping points have already been broken through, causing feedback loops such as the melting of artic ""permafrost"" releasing methane in huge quantities, the loss of woodland, rainforest, wetland, coral, grassland. If we stop emitting greenhouse gases today, the planet will continue to warm and we are locked into 3 degrees at least.\n\nIf it were easy to achieve natural equilibrium with our current technology, then we would have done it already. The fact that we can\'t, that green technology hasn\'t taken over and solved our problem should show that it\'s because it can\'t do that which people desperately hope. Our economy and growth is due less to the increasing productivity of people than the ever increasing burning of fuels. That is the foundation of our civilization and even if it could be changed there isn\'t the time. Year on year the economy needs to grow and to do so needs to burn more fossil fuels.\n\nOn more immediate problems regarding revolution is where one gets their food and water. We in the UK import a large amount of our food and there would be mass starvation if those imports stopped. Food production can be made more efficient by moving to many small-scale farms with more people working the land, but this is fighting against the infrastructure, economy, and society that has been built up over the last 100 or so years and is no simple thing. Any revolution will end the current system relying on huge supply chains and cause mass shortage of just about everything. Chaos will ensue, many people will die, and there are plenty who don\'t believe nature is breaking down to be willing to do anything and instead will fight against change with weapons.\n\nWe are truly facing extinction now. The current path of civilization is taking us to 6-12 degrees warming by the end of the century, extinction is 3 or 4. This is not a time for utopianism - always a fools errand - but grief. The life on which we depend is dying off at rarely seen rates, by our own hands, and there is little that can be done, especially when those who do want to change still have humanity at the centre, clinging onto a way of life that is already know to be inhumane. \n\nThis is our deathbed moment and we are out shopping for electric cars and installing solar panels with materials scoured from the earth, thinking we are so good. Use the time to recognise our hubris and grieve for what is being lost and has been lost, for the ways of life we used to live, not treating nature as ""out there"" but \nthat in which we lived and was in us. To die thinking us separate and above will be the final betrayal, at least give a moment of humility and self awareness in the time before we go.', 'There is a book just released uncovering a global economic theory that\'s effectively capitalism 2.0 which changes the way we capitalize things and retains industrialization. It\'s called ""The Cost of Saving the World"".', 'On point A, there\'s a bunch of information you might find useful here:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global\\_cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cooling)\n\nFor example, ""By the 1970s, scientists were becoming increasingly aware that estimates of global temperatures showed cooling since 1945, as well as the possibility of large scale warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases. In the scientific papers which considered climate trends of the 21st century, less than 10% were inclined towards future cooling, while most papers predicted future warming.""\n\nI don\'t know about you, but I\'d not base scientific consensus on what less than 10% of scientists said. Furthermore, as science has gotten better at understanding the climate, the more it has become apparent that the general trend is towards a warmer climate. In addition, the reason that the phrase ""climate change"" or more recently ""climate crisis"" is often used instead of ""global warming"" is because the problem isn\'t just warming, in general the problem is the breakdown of predictable weather patterns, with increases in extreme weather events. These extreme weather events make living on Earth much harder, as life depends on predictable weather patterns.\n\nOn point B, it\'s interesting to me that you\'ve framed the question as ""still keep a good standard of life/technology if not better?"". For starters, since when has ""good standard of technology"" mattered as much as good standard of life? The two are separate. We can still have technology but our relationship with it will need to change. We can\'t continue with the same destructive consumerist habits, and that includes the planned obsolescence that is a common trait in high-end consumer technology.\n\nIn other words, expecting life to continue without disruption to your personal lifestyle habits is not realistic, our current relationship with technology is not sustainable, but a better world can still be built. Before you try to convince others of what\'s possible, I\'d suggest looking into those alternative visions for yourself. As a starting point, worth looking into solarpunk, which is an attempt to envision a future that balances nature with technology, as well as new economic systems so that we can try to avoid treating the world as something to plunder rather than nurture:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twGcjDnOb\\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twGcjDnOb_U)\n\nConsider this, would you be more willing to use less technology if you also got the chance to work less? A big part of a potential solution to climate change is in reducing how much we consume, but this also needs to come with the ability to work less whilst still getting what you need to survive. If you had the option to be richer in time but had less stuff, would this be a trade-off you\'d consider making?', '[James Howard Kunstler](https://youtu.be/v5ZRbuOm8GM) wrote a series of books based on this premise. It imagines what a post-carbon society would look like. Highly recommend.\n\n[World Made by Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Made_by_Hand)', ""I think there's enough written about your first question here so I would just focus on the second. The way I would explain to my mum is: \n\nOverconsumption doesn't equations better living standards. If I consume one unit of petrol wisely (only driving when necessary and making use of public transport), I can be equally happy as when I had 2 units of petrol and I drove anywhere when I can walk.\n\nSo I would agree we all need to take a hard look at our lives and consider what truly are necessities. And the for luxuries we feel we need (like electronics, game consoles), is there a way to source more sustainable products? Obviously, cut out the luxuries that we have now that isn't giving us the most enjoyment and isn't sustainable. (sport cars, flying to holidays instead of taking trains, driving to Aldi instead of walking). \n\nAlso I agree with most XRs and another post here, there is no such thing as a miracle cure. Carbon capture is 20 years too late to save humanity. So tell your mum that ditching some technology (such as carbon capture, shale gas etc) isn't going to lower human's living standards.

And how we use natures powers?

Covid made it a bit difficult to get there but we managed, no flights needed. We actually had to visit two days in a row because we wanted to try all of it. Lunch was sustainable and simple and tasted great. The education we got there was straightforward, huge fun and well executed and fact based. Plus we left with a feeling we weren't the only ones dreaming of big changes in the way we use our world. Funny enough the locals don't seem to like visitors much, but there are still plenty of places to stay and do for the curious green thinking visitor. We didn't have time to visit  Vejlerne, the biggest North European Ornithological Reserve, north from Naturkraft. But we really wanted to. 

And just now I read that Naturkraft is struggling financially because of Covid lockdowns. Shit. Someone finally do make something like this, and visitors couldn't get to them for years.

Anyway. If anyone need a place to go with their kids to learn more about sustainability and natures powers this could be it? I highly recommend it. The top ranking country in the CCPI index is Denmark btw.

Look at what happened to occupy wall st. The first time the left flexed its atrophied muscles in like 30-40 years and it devolved into an ineffective shitshow as every cause and issue that **does need attention** was tacked onto it. \n\nEven though I don\'t think the green new deal goes far enough. and am frustrated that so many of y\'all have latched onto it as if it\'s the saving grace of the planet instead of pushing for more... viewing the green new deal as bare minimum a given, If you want to push this, you will end up sapping energy away from the overturning of Roe v Wade. \n\nIf we\'re striking for Roe V. Wade now, *that* needs to be the focus and it can\'t be just a ""everyone take the day off work"", we need to have it hit hard to force the state to buckle, because without the support of other unions, the state will *easily* outlast us.\n\nThough post-covid, we might have a slight advantage, since infrastructure is already weak. Roads must be blocked off and public transportation needs to be crippled or sabotaged. Bus tires are too dangerous to deflate with a knife, [but there are other ways](https://curateview.com/take-air-out-of-tire/), subways and trains need to be prevented or unable from moving from their stations. I wouldn\'t suggest physically standing on the tracks or setting up barricades while the train is actually moving because that could hurt someone, but when the strain is stopped at the stations is good times to start throwing cinder blocks or wet cement onto the tracks in front of it or prevent the train from closing it\'s doors and leaving by running human chains or physical chains with padlocks through it.\n\nSomehow getting airports to join the strike would be the ideal, though I don\'t have an answer here since this is what killed unions in the first place and TSA wont hesitate to shoot.  \n\n It can\'t be just folks volunteering to strike. You need to force *everyone* to strike by preventing them from going to work, make it so they *cannot* cross the picket line. Barricades and defensive measures too hold up traffic and defend against police crackdowns. If you want a general strike, there are only two ways, either you have the means to support it and you prepare, which the left has not done, or you use the time to cripple daily life as much as possible, because a wild cat strike is not sustainable. \n\nThe state will survive the strike, so what this needs to be is an opportunity to make the state buckle and to energize the protestors by showing them their collective strength. A ramp up, so to speak, to incentivize and threaten what a prepared and organized general strike can do. It needs to hit hard, weather the follow up retaliation of the state, and hit back harder. \n\n\nEveryone involved should have at least cut their teeth in some way during the george floyd uprising, the trump era or the fore mentioned OWS, so i shouldn\'t have to explain how to dress or utilize a blackblocc to defend other protestors. \n\nOne thing I see that is going ruin this is that people allow themselves to be arrested. They just stand there and think it\'s a grand political statement to go boneless as they\'re dragged away. Every person arrested is another ally off the street.  If you want to be effective, you need to know you outnumber the cops. Do not let them drag people away. Struggle, resist and pull people away from cops when they\'re nabbed. Don\'t just stand there and film while they kneel on the neck of your comrade. **De-Arrest people**. Make the cops scared of going after us. \n\nTargets on the street should be companies that supported the overturn of Roe v Wade. Businesses and buildings (not churches, that would just be negative PR) who supported the supreme court need to have their windows smashed, their interiors broken, their doors chained and padlocked, whatever can be done to disrupt their daily business and prevent them from making money during the length of the strike. They need to feel pressure so that they put pressure on the state about this ruling. \n\nBring changes of clothes and frequently trade articles of clothes with other protestors to prevent identifications. Drones are a thing now and the only times cops ever use body cams is when they\'re filming protestors. Use your bodies to shield other people while they change clothes. \n\nY\'all need to talk to small businesses and food suppliers. If you want this strike to work, you need support. People can\'t afford to take time off work, even for this, and risk losing their house or having their family go hungry because they lost this job. Since there is no infrastructure support from prep with the unions like i mentioned before, it means we need to talk to folks who *can* provide for strikers. Shops or organizations to donate food and water.\n\nLearn the fucking city. Know the streets and alleyways, make escape plans. The cops will try to corral protestors and strikers into specific areas and kettle them in, either for arrest or prevent traffic congestion. Y\'all need to move like water. You need to be able to condense into large groups, push forward, and disperse when the cops start to react so you can move to another condensing. More than likely, depending on the actual size of the strike, since again, monday is too soon for people to just do it, they will bring cops from outside the city, county or even out of state to reinforce. They wont know the city beyond the maps and gps that they\'re given, so y\'all have the advantage if you\'re smart of about it. Make the fuckin\' pigs hustle and tired. \n\nA common strategy cops like to do is driving motorcyles and cars into crowds of strikers and protestors to break them up. We saw it during the inauguration, berkely, the george floyd uprising, etc. Everyone mocked it, but throwing debris, barricades, wood and trashcans in the street can minimize the cops willingness to do this. Depending how far you\'re willing to go, hotwiring/pushing cars, or sacrificing your own car, to form barricades will be incredibly useful. They care more about the money and cost of their equipment than they care about your life, so make them afraid to break their shit. \n\nI\'ll probably be downvoted or banned for promoting violence or someshit, even though I have only mentioned inanimate objects and property and have not said a word about, nor advocated violence against people, but y\'all need to finally understand just ""voting"" is not enough. \n\nWe need clarity of focus. We need to hit hard and show the state it can buckle.', ""I think it's a good way to build solidarity"", 'usually i’d agree with that EXCEPT in the next couple of days the court is also expected to gut the EPAs authority to regulate climate related issues like GHG emissions\n\nSo the common factor is a court that’s been packed, acting as the henchmen of last resort for the criminals responsible for climate, environmental AND human rights destruction \n\nIn this moment it serves to all shout with one voice: ABORT THIS COURT', 'I could argue it does when looking at it like this: the more oppressive/corrupt in general that the gov becomes, the less likely it is to do anything about climate change.

The nude activists were then covered in ‘oil’ laying down on the ground.

Luxury cars like Ferraris are the most polluting cars if you look the [GreenerCars ratings](https://greenercars.org/). They say it's because there are less than 1000 sales for those cars so it doesn't really make a difference. But I mean, what a symbol!

Vote in your primaries!,maxweinhold123,9,vdz4zu,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/vdz4zu/vote_in_your_primaries/,0,"Hi all, in civic societies it's extremely important to have a mix of civil disobedience, and civic engagement. Civil disobedience attracts vital attention to a cause, while civic engagement ensures that the people who support your issues hold political power. 

While everyone likely knows about the importance of voting, especially in local elections (where elections regularly come down to a couple hundred votes or less), fewer young people actively engage in other parts of democracy, including writing your representatives (pro tip: don't directly write to a representative, write to the staffers. This will give you a greater chance to be noticed, increased the odds of having a one-on-one with them, and inform someone with a direct ear to the rep), and voting in primaries. 

I'm in Maryland, and in the democratic primary for governor coming up there's a range between someone who believes that chicken poop power is more important than investments in renewables, and someone with one of the most ambitious climate plans in the country. Usually, it's only the elderly that have high turnout in primaries, who typically are not as well versed on climate issues, and so come the general election we have to choose between a giant douche and a turd sandwich, which doesn't help matters much at all. 

So find some friends and encourage each other to vote in primaries; this allows candidates who actually have good ideas to show up to the general election, where they have a much higher chance of being elected and actually creating a change.",1655422594.0,9,0,,[]

If they are going to continue investing in our community and a mine here—they should also make sure their own investors aren’t being lied to by corrupt grifters like Constantine mine and the Haines Assembly.\n\nIt is economic malfeasance to allow these investors to unknowingly fund the destruction of human beings and natural resources, it is a huge financial liability for them—as well as a direct betrayal of the wishes of the people of Japan.

How our thinking traps us in the problem.,bpj1975,15,v06cik,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/v06cik/how_our_thinking_traps_us_in_the_problem/,4,"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/confronting-the-technological-society

Came across Jaques Ellul via the ironic Anti-tech podcast. He thinks that our way of thinking started a chain reaction towards a totalitarian technological society, and to get out of it means thinking differently.

""Methods rationally arrived at and having maximum efficiency"" is how he describes it. If we do this, we feed the Machine, and the Machine will eat everything. 

There are 7 aspects to this:
Rationality (systematisation and standardisation)
Artificiality (subjugation and destruction of nature)
Automatisation (technical means via mathematical standards of efficiency)
Self-augmentation (advances build on each other)
Wholeness (everything shares a common essence)
Universalism (ie, global)
Autonomy (it has its own laws and determinations)

He suggests that all other apects of our lives are now conditioned by the above, and we are sliding into totalitarianism.

Now, back to XR. You can overthrow a people but not a system of thought. A true revolution cuts against the grain of history, otherwise you just reform or speed up what was happening anyway. A true revolution would not be strategic or calculating. It would not develop doctrine or tactics. These reinforce Technique, and feed the Machine. We must reject the habits of thought that have been instilled in us. Play another game. Be irrational, spiritual, natural, manual, diverse, don't build on what has been done, be interdependant with other life.

I was a sailor on the ship and saw it all first hand.\n\nI am activating as a Humpback Whale conservationist after 20 years of work and research due to the actions of the Zen Buddhist Wynn Bruce on the Supreme Court steps on Earth Day.\n\nGreta Thunberg has been my role model as a conservationist—even though she is half my age—from the moment I watched her cuss out the U.N. on television.\n\nI wanted to share this video because this is me cussing out the entire corrupt Alaska State government and bureaucracy for their crimes—for all Alaskans to hear. \n\nI would never have had the wherewithal or know how to achieve this, if it had not been for Greta Thunberg’s leadership and guidance in the global movement to call out the corruption which is eating our planet alive.\n\nAnd as an autistic person there is no one else on this planet I look up to as highly—hands down.\n\nSo thanks for the help and leadership, and the presence of the ExtinctionRebellion online; backwoods conservationists like myself can see it and learn to protest the local governments that are burning our forests and killing all the animals. (In Alaska there’s a powerful fake green movement in the bureaucracy which smothers any real conservation effort in the cradle—the result of decades of oil baron control of our legislature.)\n\nIf this is off topic and needs to be removed—sorry for bothering. I just wanted to share my conservation with ExtinctionRebellion specifically, for unambiguously describing the actual situation on this planet, and to say thank you to Greta Thunberg in public for her global leadership. Especially as a GenX-er—it’s good to see the entire future is in capable hands with such leaders already getting to work so effectively.\n\nA brief intro to the video I wrote for Alaskans follows, thank you very much.\n\n—An Alaskan Hermit\n\n---\n\nI’m a folklorist and former Inland Boatman Union (IBU) Able Seaman who was present when the M/V Kennicott struck and killed a humpback whale in Kodiak harbor in the summer of 2014–as reported in this KTOO News article:\n\n[Whale Collision With Kennicott Under Investigation](https://www.ktoo.org/2014/08/01/whale-collision-kennicott-investigation/).\n\nThere was no investigation that I saw—and this article here erroneously states that the humpback whale “died instantly”—which is definitely not true. I was in the forecastle just before the whale was discovered and it heard it thrashing powerfully against the hull before it died. I reported this to several of my superiors.\n\nAlso, I was on the bridge at the helm up till about 30-40 minutes before the whale was discovered on the bow, and I relate events as I saw them up there…which made it look to me a lot like that whale had been killed negligently. (I just relate what I saw at the time. Since there was no real investigation, I don’t actually know what happened.)\n\nI reported a whale call out that occurred just before the whale strike to the captain and the mate on the bridge as they were reviewing the incident and expected to be interviewed by investigators. That never happened. No one ever spoke to me, and when I inquired about it I was told they had already come and gone and just spoke to officers and the people who discovered the whale.\n\nIn my opinion both the strike and the investigation seemed to be the results of gross incompetence at best, possibly criminal negligence, and maybe even much worse—if they used the bureaucracy to cover up the real incident as it appeared from my view that they did.\n\nI’m not a whistleblower. I’m just telling the story of what I saw for other Alaskans. I don’t think there’s anything to be done. The state of Alaska is too corrupt right now.\n\nBut I figured sharing this story—about how the Alaska state government and bureaucracy kills humpback whales with state resources, and then spends Alaska dollars to cover the incident up rather than investigate it properly—might actually serve some purpose for Alaskans, as we continue watching our robber baron overlords destroy the entire state while no one in power does anything.\n\nThanks for your time. I hope you enjoy the storytelling in the video. It’s a little long—but I wanted to tell the story of the events accurately as I experienced and saw them. \n\nP.S. Oh yeah—you get to meet my Alaskan Malamute in the video, too. He never leaves my side and steals scenes whenever he wants!']"

However, even small scale crop farming kills creatures and too often works to sterilise it's little plot of land, and in my experience there are no thoughts of grief over this.\n\nYour last sentence is part of what I am arguing against.

As if now that the life is dead the soy, palm, etc is shame-free.\n\nTo the first comment, I have spent a fair amount of time around 30+ year long vegans, whom arrived at veganism from pacifism, so yes this does not apply so much to those who do so for more utilitarian reasons"", 'What is it about rotten humans who aren\'t Civilized - let\'s just call them, IDK, ""savages"" - that they don\'t try to reduce suffering of non-humans whom they prey upon or even neighboring humans they may rival or befriend as times dictate?

And in this regard, the great diminishment of humanity is good (from any individual\'s POV, if it\'s others not you) so as not to be too many predators.\n\nAnd no, I don\'t think worldwide veganism is feasible, nor is ""more efficient distribution of available food"" or anything else which gets proposed to pretend that we can perpetuate techno-industrial Civilization. We have to face a harsh reality, that it must end and it won\'t go easy. Starvation is really only going to happen in the initial phase, soon enough we will be at a population level which can be sustained by the landscapes inhabited.\n\nBut moreover, while I am aware of all the touted health benefits of veganism, it seems to me that what works for humans is what we\'ve evolved and adapted to do, the things we\'ve come to eat over time, which is not formulated by laboratories or delivered to the hungry with zero effort exerted. Even if veganism is adequate (or better than omnivorous diet) as regards human nutrition, then we have to consider (or observe) what are the consequences which ripple for the rest of Life on Earth when one species declines to die off as it always had. We humans evolved in tandem with all the rest, and for us to exist at far greater numbers and for longer than we historically have *has an enormous impact* upon all the rest of our Earthling brethren.\n\nOften, we *cannot foresee* all the ripples which will result from our (technological) interventions to/against what wild Nature delivers, and that has observably delivered us to the edge of total catastrophe. If we can\'t predict or control the outcomes from our tinkering with a system as complex and multifaceted as is Nature then it\'s best if we refrain from making interventions.\n\nAnd, importantly, there naturally exists a greater demand for food than its supply. This prevents waste and gluttony, and being a bit hungry is fine (even good) for the human animal, it\'s no tragedy. Agriculture and technology (under either capitalism or socialism) upends this, *to the longterm detriment of all* and only for the short-term benefit of Civilized humans.']"

On the same day that the Public Order Bill was tabled UK Met Office researchers said that there’s now around a fifty-fifty chance that the world will warm by more than 1.5C over the next five years. [1]\n\nThe move by Extiction Rebellion comes as a Yougov poll reveals that disruptive protest is increasing the numbers of people in the UK willing to take climate action, with around 1.7 million adults in the UK saying they would consider engaging in climate action over the next 12 months. The poll also found that: “When asked about satisfaction with the efforts of the UK government, only 26.1% of UK adults thought the government was doing a lot to tackle climate change, with 46% disagreeing with this statement.” [2]\xa0\n\nCharlie Waterhouse from Extinction Rebellion, said: “It is foolish to think that announcing new curbs in the Queen’s Speech will stop people taking to the streets to demand their government act to ensure a safe future for people in the UK and around the world.\xa0\n\n“As we in Extinction Rebellion know full well: what we do works. It’s worked countless times before. It has worked to give us weekends and the vote, human rights and freedom. And it will work again. Faced with a government incapable of anything other than a desperate attempt to shore-up its own power and cover-up its criminality it is the only thing we can do. To be a bystander is not enough.\n\n“\u200b\u200bWhen juries are asked to sit in judgement of their peers, they are acquitting. The Government’s increasing reliance on private injunctions shows that they know they cannot rely on the courts, because the courts agree with us.”\n\n“So Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, we thank you. Our organisations were set up to break the law to drive positive change. Your actions show that we are winning.”\n\nExtinction Rebellion’s announcement comes as increasingly extreme climate impacts are being felt around the world this spring, with over 400 killed in deadly flooding in South Africa and unprecedented 50 degree heatwaves in India and Pakistan leading to critical water and electricity shortages as well as crop failures. [3] [4]\n\nFollowing the failure of the COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow last autumn, Extinction Rebellion announced plans to mobilise two million people in 2022, equivalent to 3.5% of the UK population. [5] The figure is taken from the work of Harvard political scientist and public policy professor Erica Chenoweth, whose research identified active engagement of 3.5% of a national population as a critical tipping point for major social change. [6]\xa0\n\nWork began in January 2022 on a nationwide doorknocking campaign, Project 3.5, aimed at mobilising a critical mass of the public in the UK. Over 6000 doorstep conversations have since taken place from Teeside to Richmond to rural West Cornwall, and 8000 people took to the streets of central London in April this year, with over 80% of those taking part in Extinction Rebellion actions for the first time. The group is scaling up the outreach campaign with a summer of doorknocking planned to spark millions of conversations between neighbours about the climate crisis and how people power can turn the situation around.\xa0\n\nNotes to editors\xa0\n\n[1] Climate change: ‘Fifty-fifty chance’ of breaching 1.5C warming limit:\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61383391\n\n[2] Just Stop Oil protests might be encouraging more climate action, survey reveals:\n\nhttps://www.socialchangelab.org/survey\n\n[3] South Africa flooding death toll nears 400 as rescuers search for missing: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/south-africa-flooding-death-toll-nears-400-as-rescuers-search-for-missing\n\n[4] ‘We are living in hell’: Pakistan and India suffer extreme spring heatwaves: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/pakistan-india-heatwaves-water-electricity-shortages\n\n[5] Extinction Rebellion announces plans for April 2022: ‘The COP process has failed, it’s up to all of us now’: https://extinctionrebellion.uk/2021/11/23/extinction-rebellion-announces-plans-for-april-2022-the-cop-process-has-failed-its-up-to-all-of-us-now/\n\n[6] The ‘3.5% rule’: How a small minority can change the world: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world\n\nABOUT EXTINCTION REBELLION\n\nTime has almost entirely run out to address the ecological crisis which is upon us, including the 6th mass species extinction, global pollution, and increasingly rapid climate change. If urgent and radical action isn’t taken, we’re heading towards 4˚C warming, and the societal collapse and mass loss of life that that implies. The younger generation, racially marginalised communities and the Global South are on the front-line. No-one will escape the devastating impacts.\n\nExtinction Rebellion believes it is a citizen’s duty to rebel, using peaceful civil disobedience, when faced with criminal inactivity by their Government.\n\nExtinction Rebellion’s key demands are:\n\nGovernment must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change.\n\nGovernment must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.\n\nGovernment must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens’ Assembly on climate and ecological justice.\n\nWhat Emergency?\xa0|\xa0Extinction Rebellion in Numbers\xa0|This Is Not A Drill: An Extinction Rebellion Handbook\xa0\n\nGet involved\n\nIn the UK, come to one of our\xa0events, join the\xa0Rebellion Network\xa0and let us know how you can help out.\n\nStart a group where you are:\xa0in the UK\xa0or\xa0around the world.\n\nFind your local group.\n\nCheck out the\xa0International XR website, with links to the French, German, Italian and UK websites.\n\nWhile you’re at it, support our\xa0fundraiser!']"

It is no denying that our planet is in trouble. 

The signs are everywhere – from the melting of the polar ice caps to the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters. And while we may not be able to see the effects of climate change with our own eyes, the scientific evidence is indisputable. But what many people don’t realize is just how quickly the earth is dying.

In fact, some experts believe that we have as little as 10 years to save the planet.

The reason for this is simple: we are putting too much strain on the earth’s resources. We are using up its water, its forests, its soil, and its minerals at an alarming rate. And we are doing it all in the name of progress.

But what kind of progress are we really making if it’s at the expense of the planet? Surely, there must be a better way to do things.

There is no easy answer, but we need to start somewhere. We need to find alternative sources of energy. We need to stop polluting the air, the water, and the soil.

In short, we need to change the way we live. It won’t be easy, but it’s something we need to do if we want to save the earth – and ourselves.

Without taking care of the earth, it will die faster than we can realize. We need to be more conscious about the things we do that damage the earth and its resources. We also need to be more proactive in finding ways to protect the earth and its inhabitants.

There is no easy answer, but we need to start somewhere need to be more conscious of the way we use the earth’s resources. We need to find more sustainable ways of living. And we need to do it now, before it’s too late. 

We need to take care of the earth so it will be safe for future generations. We need to recycle, reduce our energy consumption, and promote sustainable practices.

I am a master's student in Communicationsciences in Ghent. 

For my master thesis, I am working on how to convince people to be spare-full with water in their households. Water scarcity is a big issue and will only get worse if we don't take action now. 

I am looking for Dutch speaking participants between the age of 18 and 26 to fill out my survey. 

It takes about 4 minutes. 

This would be very helpful in research on how to activate people to behave more ecologically.

The game is to make people feel like the solution is in the hands of individuals, who must ""make better choices"" - about food, transportation, consumption, etc. and ""go green."" It's a game designed to lose from the start, promoted and pushed by special interests, yet willingly picked up and repeated endlessly.  

Fact: There is no way that huge numbers of individuals are going to change enough behaviors around structurally embedded energy use patterns, on their own, to move the needle back from Red Alert.

Shifting responsibility to individuals is a tactic used by other incumbent special interests: ""ask your doctor if ..."" and ""just say no"" and ""please drink responsibly"" and so forth - it's cynical and deliberate. 

In the carbon catastrophe context, the effect of this campaign plays into the hands of the carbon abusers perfectly. Individuals who say ""I'm good, I eat vegetarian now"" feel like they're doing something, enough, and it blunts their resolve. They become complacent. The folks who say ""there's no way my switching to vegetarianism is going to have an impact"" give up in apathy. 

These recommendations for ""going green"" are often racist and classist also. ""Bike to work"" isn't really an option for millions of people living in concrete deserts, forced to commute tens of miles because of economics. ""Buy an EV"" isn't an option for millions living paycheck to paycheck. Simplistic memes such as these are cruel because they are so well disguised as good guidance, and yet are impossible for huge numbers of people.

None of this is lost on the PR and propaganda machines of the oil majors and their political henchmen.

To solve this, people need specific, individual-sized tasks that send a strong message, are leveraged, and keep the focus on the responsible parties directly. Not that we should ignore our personal choices and act ignorantly, but we should not play this shell game where the card we look under - our personal choices - is the wrong one. The political and corporate power holders are hiding where we aren't looking and continuing to ignore the catastrophe because they still profit from it.

>You are nowhere close but you could be.An Open Letter to XR after the April Rebellion.Please shareIn 2018, along with a small group of other people, I helped to co found Extinction Rebellion. I presented the first paper to these activists, arguing a Rebellion against the British government over its inaction on the climate crisis was now viable and necessary. I created the mobilisation plans for the first year of XR. I wrote the initial strategic design for the April 2019 Rebellion.Let’s remind ourselves. XR was set up to create a rebellion against the British government. This means that your actions have to take a serious and credible aim at this objective. XR was set up to tell the truth and to act as if that truth was real, regardless of the consequences. XR is neither aiming at this objective, nor telling the truth.The truth is two fold:First, we are facing global social collapse. The 2022 IPCC report predicts up to 700 million refugees by 2030, in eight year’s time. And that is just Africa. Half the people in Africa.Second “we have to act quickly” as Sir David King says – if we don’t start winning in the next three years we condemn humanity to hell for hundreds of thousands of years.This situation is totally and utterly unique. Any analysis which is based upon the past has no purchase on the next decade. The unimaginable is about to happen and the world will never be the same again. The notion that XR is a “social movement”, an “environmental campaign”, a “network of activists”, completely misses the point. It is a mad dash to save our children and the lives of billions of the poorest people on the planet.Nothing. Nothing at all compares to this.You are failing because you are stuck in your fears and therefore you cannot bring yourselves to create the level of disruption necessary to force the change we need in the time we have. You have the numbers, you could win, but you are all hedging. To succeed you will have to challenge your family relationships, risk your job, and give up your social status. You will have to resist to the point of arrest and imprisonment. And not stop.You are failing because you are not telling yourselves this truth. There is an abject failure of leadership. True leadership is about speaking unpopular truth. A movement that rejects such leadership falls into inertia and disintegration.There is no excuse. You have heard the Heading for Extinction talk. You know. You may delude yourselves on this, but there is no going back, even if your privileges temporally give you that option. In truth you have no choice.There are many reasons to step up. But the most important reason is to save yourselves from agonising guilt and shame – the utter self contempt of knowing, a few years from now, that you could have resisted, but you chose not to. The most important thing in this life is your own self respect – abiding by the voice of your inner conscience. You may pretend this is not the case, but it may be good to consult thousands of years of wisdom the subject.  True “self interest” is always to act for the Good not for the Self.So what to do?Assume fearless leadership. Stand up in your XR meeting and make a declaration. Either people commit to the central purpose of XR – to engage in ongoing civil disobedience or leave to join one of the many organisations which are going through the motions as the world burns. A clear and coherent strategy will encourage many more to join. Everyone sits down, as a community of resistance, and organises putting their lives into order – speak to their family and their boss. As people do when they prepare to enter a war. Because this is a war and we need a nonviolent army.Some people may not be happy with what I have written. I am not here to be popular. We have to be honest with each other.I dearly love people in XR, I speak and talk with many of you every week. You are very beautiful people, without a doubt. But beautiful people do terrible things. In Nazi Germany “nice” people kissed their children each morning before going off to murder millions of people. At the moment you are doing the same.The situation is deadly serious.

Roger  sounds increasingly desperate. I wonder at what point the penny will  drop, and he will realise that a key part of the problem - at least from  his point of view - is his own message.  I am not questioning his  motives or his commitment. The problem is that his understanding of the  situation is too simplistic. He thinks the British government can change  this, and that putting pressure on them might actually make this  happen.

>""We  have to be honest with each other"".

Yes, we absolutely do. But first of  all we have to be brutally honest with ourselves about what is really  going on and about what futures are actually possible.

>""Because this is a war and we need a nonviolent army.""

It  is not a war, just like the ""war on terror"" wasn't a war. And we don't need an army. What we need is a coherent plan. We need a much better public understanding of the real situation and the real options for the  future. And right now Roger Hallam is not actually helping to make that  happen. Right now he is making impossible demands about impossible  futures, because he himself has not faced up to the true scale of the  problems.

The world he is trying to save cannot be saved. The question we need to ask is what *can* be saved, and how. For example, it is not going to include most of the inevitable billion+ African refugees by 2030. There is very little we could do now to reduce that number, even if we could magically solve the political obstacles to significant change. It's too late for that. And given that we are heading for a ""cost of living crisis"" with no end and the worst food crisis in human history (the first ever global famine), there is also no country on Earth that is going to be willing to accept these refugees. That is the grim truth. Denying it in the name of humanitarian ideals will not stop it from being true, but the widespread acknowledgement that it is true might just have the power to change the political landscape all over the world. Not to save those 1 billion refugees, but to transform our own societies in order to minimise the death toll here. At the moment he's appealling to people's consciences - ""we need to save the Africans!"" It won't work. ""We need to save ourselves"" is a message that is much harder to ignore.

This is what I mean when I talk about reality and realism. We've had 60 years of environmentalist idealism, and it *doesn't work*. We have to be honest about the way our political systems work and the way human beings really feel, think and behave. Running about waving in your arms in the air screaming about hundreds of millions of dead Africans might scare people and make them depressed, but it won't change anything. Instead we need to calmly explaining that those people are doomed and that if we don't fundamentally re-organise our own (western) societies then so are we.

Roger Hallam\'s talk of global social collapse this decade unless we do something in the next 3 years seemed pretty apocalyptic: I was very worried, so I did some googling..\n\nCompared to the year 1900 we already have 1.1°C of warming, by 2030 it will be 1.3°C and by 2050 it will be 2°C, after which things get less easy to predict and a lot more scary. Long term climate change is a big deal, but 2030 is going to be similar to the climate we have now.\n\nMany countries can and will find ways of adapting to a hotter climate. Holland is already below sea level. Singapore is already hot. Japan already has typhoons. USA already has tornadoes, and all of them cope pretty well. We could cope with all of those things too, but it would be both very inconvenient and expensive.\n\nI read a book called ""Why Nations Fail"" which argues persuasively that political systems are the real reason why some nations are more successful than others. The stark contrast between North and South Korea is nothing to do with culture, religion, resources, climate or race, and everything to do with government. It is easy to imagine which of the two Koreas will be better able to cope with the challenges of a changing climate. In Africa, which packs the list of top 20 worst governments of the world, there has been a president who rigged the lottery so that he won, another denied the existence of Aids, another literally caused a famine in their own country. To have millions of refugees in Africa is unfortunately normal, with or without climate change, and I don\'t feel responsible for saving them.\n\nIMHO, a better argument for urgent action is to start talking about the COST that rich countries such as UK are going to pay for changing the climate.

And the truth is that there isn\'t going to be any international solidarity, and until we are willing to admit this truth then there is no viable way forwards. That\'s not an ethical judgement - I am not saying ""there should not be any international solidarity"".  What I am saying is that the primary reason we are in the current mess is because there has been no international solidarity to stop climate change and all of other ongoing ""tragedy of the commons"" ecological disasters, and there cannot be. There is simply no way to make it happen, because real power lies at the level of sovereign states, and the leaders of sovereign states have a primary obligation to their own citizens (and if they neglect that obligation they will not remain in power).\n\nThere is no point in aiming for impossible things because the possible things aren\'t likable.', '> Is your realistic plan to build a magical barrier around the UK that lets food and energy in but keeps people out?\n\nThe UK is a poor example for this sort of argument, given that we have a very large ""moat"" to keep people out.

It makes sense to start that adaptation as soon as possible.\n\nThere is no point in couching this argument in terms of climate change though. We can already see from what is happening right now that the cost that will provoke real change is the cost of fossil energy rather than the cost of the pollution created by burning it. That is because the atmosphere is an example of Garrett Hardin\'s ""commons"". In other words, every person and country on Earth can dump CO2 into the shared atmosphere and nobody can hold them to account, but nobody can get hold of gas or oil unless they pay for it. And we have already reached the point where large numbers of people can\'t afford to pay for it, and it is only going to get worse.

I used scary words, warning her that this is our very, very, very last chance to prevent irreversible catastrophe. When I sent it in the mail, I said to myself: ""Hey! That felt really good."" My heart does feel a little better for doing it. 

I know that won't do diddly squat for the planet, but I still did it because it's the right thing to do. I also know you'll say things like: ""That's not enough."" ""You have to try even harder,"" ""You have to give it all your might if you care."" ""You must give it every last ounce of strength, whether you want to or not.""

I'm satisfied with the level of work I've been doing. I'll scream it to the world: ""I'M PROUD OF WHAT I DID!! I'M PROUD OF WHAT I DID!!"" ""I'M PROUD OF WHAT I DID!!!"" 

 My body and soul can only take so much before it snaps. I said my piece, I used the right words, and that's good enough for me. I can't bear the weight of the world on my shoulders much longer. Writing that letter to my Governor was good, but it took a lot out of me. If I have to do some kind of herculean  task right now to help the planet, my body's going to give in, and I'll have a severe heart attack that will put me in the hospital.

Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using “overnight” costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes.

In other terms, one has to build an average plant every 2/3 days every week of every year up to 2050.\n\nBefore you start telling me that I don\'t take efficiency gains in the equation, I tell you: Yes  these gains are already included. See, according to the nuclear industry, there are ~400 nuclear reactors online which generated 2,657 TWh (9.5EJ) in 2019. While BP says 6,923 TWh ; That\'s because they already multiply their numbers with an ""input-equivalent"" factor which takes into account that non thermal plants powering electric engines and heat pumps are way more efficient than thermal plants and thermal engines [(their explanation)](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2021-methodology-for-converting-non-fossil-fuel-primary-energy.pdf).\n\nSo the conclusion? \nWe have not enough time to build as much power plants.

Great', 'You cannot build a reactor in the desert. They are designed to flood as a failsafe mechanism, which is why they are built near bodies of water', ""I wonder if the legal frameworks aren't really just overbearing. It was easier to build older, less safe reactors in the past, and it's easier to keep them running even over their rated lifetime, than it is to build new safer reactors. Perhaps the bar moved a bit too high, without real, tangible benefits, but too much added costs. Certainly, situations like Chernobyl and Fukushima should be analyzed and reactor designs should be improved, but those improvements are already included in new designs, with passive means to stop the reactions and better safety controls. Many countries have been running reactors for more than 50 years now and the track record for safety is very good, certainly better than coal and oil, and can only get better.\n\n\nMy understanding is also that each reactor is certified completely separately, so even if let's say you wanted to build 10 identical ones, you still need to have each of them to go through the same lengthy process, instead of reusing some of the validation that was already done for past reactors. And because new reactors are built so rarely, regulatory bodies simply aren't staffed sufficiently and don't have the experience to deal with it in a timely manner."", 'Yes and no.

Until then, nuclear is the most ecological source of power to fill in the gaps. \n\nTurn of fossil fuel plants first and nuclear plants, when renewables can handle the demand.', '[deleted]', ""Nuclear is a distraction. The time it takes to build a nuclear plant (around five years) means they cannot address current energy demand or cost issues. The carbon footprint to build one is gigantic, using carbon-intensive resources such as concrete and steel. The cost, often subsidised by Government, is astronomical and leads to higher overall fuel bills. And that ignores the long-term waste storage issue, which we still haven't solved. I'm much more in favour of redirecting that investment into renewables. Particularly in the UK, we have so much potential for off-show wind that just isn't being used. Marine and tidal energy are also options."", ""I most often see people from the US & EU pushing for more nuclear, and this reveals a major bias: Those countries already have the infrastructure in place to make more nuclear power stations feasible. Most of the world does not.\n\nPart of this is a matter of physical infrastructure, which could be imported and built over about a decade, but I'm far more concerned about intellectual infrastructure.\n\nPower plants do not run themselves. They need trained engineers to design, build, maintain and operate them. But engineers are not so easily built. As a science teacher, I can confidently say that it takes 18 years just to get someone ready for a university education, and there is no general shortcut around that. Then it takes about another half decade to get really academically qualified. People are only just barely ready to start this work around age 25.\n\nBut academic achievement doesn't happen in a vacuum. To support that one student takes teams of primary and secondary teachers, and then most especially tertiary-level lecturers. A full professor is unlikely to be less than 30 years old, and one with sufficient real-world industry experience to really know what they're teaching is more like 40+. And if they don't exist, there's a top-down inability to train anyone else in their field. No lecturers means no teachers, and no teachers means no students.\n\nMost engineering schools around the world are currently set up to teach fossil or hydro-based power generation, with some already shifted towards wind and solar too, which require very little change in training. But very few universities teach nuclear engineering. This is not surprising, since only 34 countries (about 15%) have even one nuclear plant, and that figure drops to only 20 countries (10%) if you lump EU members together. Since most of the world has never used nuclear power, their universities are unlikely to be set up to teach nuclear engineering and have relevant lecturers. We cannot split the relatively small number of existing nucear engineers across the whole planet, so we'd have to train way more. But we also can't split the existing lecturers to train the whole planet, so we'd have to first train up huge numbers of new lecturers.\n\nBottom line is, increasing nuclear power (safely and effectively) will not take the typical 10-year build time of a new power plant. It is more likely to take a whole generation or two, to catch up on missing skills; call it 40 to 50 years. And that takes us to the 2060s, when it's too late to reap the climate change benefits.\n\nSolar and wind lean on technologies that most science-oriented universities around the world are already well prepared to teach, and they're generally faster to build. We can have them ready in time."", 'Better than fossil fuels, worse than renweables but in almost all cases economically unrealistic and therefore not really an important question.', ""I'm generally in favour, but only in countries that are stable enough to support the long term infrastructure costs to prevent accidents.  (I'm not so sure the USA is in that boat at the moment tbh.)\n\nI saw a pretty convincing article in Scientific American, with the environmental movement represented as a big pie chart with like twenty slices representing different efforts where things need to happen.  Nuclear energy was just one of the slices -- it isn't going to solve everything, but NONE of the slices is going to solve everything."", '[deleted]', 'I don’t know how I feel about the “uneconomical arguments against nuclear. It’s only currently uneconomical because of issues with policy and such things like regulation and zoning. If government were to make a concerted effort the costs should be capable of being reduced. \n\nI get frustrated when economics is talked about as if it’s this existential foreign thing we haven’t entirely made up and couldn’t fundamentally reshape. \n\nEspecially looking at the newest iterations of nuclear power stations they have smaller footprints and significantly lower chances for meltdowns and other major accidents. \n\nOne major argument against renewables is the requirement for long term and efficient storage to make it a viable replacement for fossil fuel power, to prevent disasters like Texas from happening and undercutting progress is renewables adoption. In addition to renewables storage we need base load generating capacity, and there aren’t many carbon-free alternatives. \n\nI could imagine that with proper funding and dedication we could initiate and complete multiple such nuclear installations within the decade. The biggest benefit, aside from the given replacement of nuclear for carbon electrical generation, would be a technology that allows us to make the clear argument that investments in renewables is a key answer to our problem. \n\nThis is because when we have guaranteed production on the nuclear aspect theres good reason for widespread adoption of renewables, because the nuclear provides that critical capacity backstop that is often used as an excuse against the switch to renewables.', 'People saying we need LESS whilst promoting action against climate change are.. well… morons.', ""I agree with Paul Hawken on this one.

I don\'t say that you did it intentionally. No problem. \n\nBut let\'s concentrate on the nuclear topic, because you will read through my words other topics of the energy supply.\n\nI\'ll try to share my knowledge, not arguing for an answer or another one. \n\nEnglish is not my first language so I\'d apologize by advance for the mistakes that I\'ll do. \n\nWhat are the consequences of each option ?\n\n1) More nuclear :\nA) Firstly, what kind of power plant ? Classic ones (modernized) with uranium or new gen with other atome like thorium ? Because it\'s not the same temporality. Humanity know how to do uranium power plant at an industrial scale. We know where are the ressources. We already have supply lines. We know the consequences of each choice trough the process.\n\nB) Where they will be built? Because having long supply chain of uranium, yellow cake, combustible etc generate a lot of greenhouse gas (GHG).\nAnd they need access to huge amounts of cold water to be operated. In my country, France, each year some of them are stopped during the Summer because rivers risk to have too less water or the rejected waters risk to warm too much rivers, bad for fauna and flora. \n\nC) How we will extract the resources ? Because today, more than half of the minerals are extracted in 3rd world countries in open sky dig sites. Kazakhstan, Ouzbékistan, Nigeria... Only first world countries like Australia or Canada mine it in underground\n\nD) How we will deal with the wastes? Some countries like mine (France) are stuck between forgetting and recycling. These wastes are dangerous for us, the environment and are hard to deal with whatever we stock or recycle them.\n\nE) These plants will need a heavy maintenance and hard work to be recycled / rehabilited\n\nF) What about risks of disaster ? Don\'t worry about that, we deal well with Tchernobyl !.. No, absolutely no. Three Mile Island was at a thin hair that a major nuclear disaster. Chernobyl irradiated badly most of Eastern, Central and West Europe and is behind an incredible sarcophagus of concrete and steel that can be disturbed by only Russians\' tank motors. Imagine about anything else major. Fukushima need continuously tons of water that are currently rejected in the ocean. The accident of Ciudad Juarez (Mexican Chernobyl) released tons of Cobalt 60 radioactive materials in the entire Mexican country. \nOkay you have it, we need to put huge efforts to protect us from a disaster. \n\nG) So we choose nuclear, we will have a continuous flow of electricity. 24h/24, 7d/7.\nThe current is already asynchronous so we don\'t need to use electrotechnical components that disturb the electrical network.\nIn comparison to most of other energy sources, nuclear plants have the best ratio of Energy produced /Space used and /time duration (40~60 years) \n\nH) But nuclear plants can\'t be used everywhere so we will need to use (as today in France) long power lines. Aerial ones are fastest and cheapest to build but are weak to the environment and the climate become and more dangerous, intense... \nSubterranean ones are a lot more costly, create electrical issues (capacity current due to long lines, very bad) and can\'t go as easy trough the terrains (mountains, rivers...) \n\n2) Less or no nuclear (I will be more quick and a bit sarcastic I think) :\nA) No fossil sources, no! Fuck them\n\nB) Again, what technology? Wind turbines? Ground or sea ones? Each of these affect fauna / Solar panels, big centrals or roofs ones? \n\nC) What materials? Ultratech ones that fly 10 times around the world? Cheapest ones that are bad to recycle and use? \n\nD) These power plants produce standardly in continuous electricity so we need to convert it to alternative. Electrotechnical components. Bad for the environment, lot of metals, chemicals... Disturbations in the power network\n\nE) They don\'t function every time ! So we need batteries, bad for the environment, costly. And maybe second power plants for bad times\n\nF) If we put them near place of consumption we save on long power lines. But we need to reinforce the network against electrical disturbations, it\'s costly.\n\nG) But they don\'t produce GHG too! No major disaster!\n\nH)... But they need to be replaced quickly. 15 years for ondulators used for solar panels (them 25 years). For wind turbines 25/30 years.\nAnd they use a  lot more space if they are used in ""plant"" pattern. Especially the solar techs.\n\n...\n\nAgain, it\'s an overview of my knowledge about these questions.

Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using “overnight” costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes.

Why isn't anyone talking about soil? The cause of a potential apocalypse by 2040!,expansiveoneness,196,u69t9t,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/u69t9t/why_isnt_anyone_talking_about_soil_the_cause_of_a/,42," 

Soil is the largest ecosystem on the planet. Each handful of soil has billions of microorganisms in it. These microorganisms are the very basis of our existence. Without them, the soil will not have organic content. If soil doesn't have organic content, then we can't grow our food. If we can't go our food, we will die of starvation. Soil extinction means that the soil has been stripped of all its organic content. The threat of soil extinction is not restricted to a small part of the world. It is estimated that 52% of the world's agricultural land is already degraded. It is estimated that at the current pace of soil extinction we are heading for a sure apocalypse sort of situation in just 30 to 40 years from now.

What is the cause of soil extinction?

Modern agricultural practices have become extremely unsustainable. A huge percentage of farmers across the world go in for mono-cropping. This means that tilled land is left open in the sun for weeks on end. This results in the death of the many microorganisms which call the soil home. This will lead to a direct decrease in the quality of the soil. The gradual degradation of soil quality will culminate in soil extinction.

How can we rejuvenate the soil?

Soil is rejuvenated when we cover it with plant and animal waste. The plant and animal waste is manure which rejuvenates the soil and enhances the organic content. It is said that soil across the world now has around 0.5% organic content. If we can increase it to around 5-6% we can rejuvenate the soil and reverse soil extinction. The general suggestion is that if a farmer has at least a small percentage of his/her agricultural land under tree cover and then uses the plant waste that it generates to rejuvenate his entire farm, then we will surely be on track towards soil rejuvenation. But this needs to happen at a global scale, small scale solutions can't reverse the damage we have done. That is why need everyone in the world to talk about soil and create awareness about it, so that we can have governments all across the world creating policies which encourage farmers to bring land under tree cover.

Carbon stored in soil is 3x that in living plants, and 2x that in the atmosphere, which means soil is crucial for carbon sequestration. Therefore unsustainable farming practices are a huge contributor to the release of greenhouse gases and as a result a direct contributor towards climate change. If the world's soils are not revitalized, they could release 850 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere contributing to climate change. This is more than all of humanity's emissions in the last 30 years combined.

Even though we are facing such a dire situation threatening our very existence, we hardly ever hear soil being discussed on mainstream media and social media.

It is extremely important that we all wake up before it is too late. We are indeed staring at a potential apocalypse. But the good news is that we have a 5-6 year window wherein we can come out of this dire situation through with the right policy change and worldwide awareness.

So all that I humbly ask you to do is just this: please do your own research on this disaster-in-waiting and please talk to literally everyone you know about this. We need worldwide awareness of this potential apocalypse. Only then will governments across the world wake up and do the necessary policy change needed to ensure that humanity doesn't die of starvation and global warming.

This is not a protest, you don't have to contribute any money. All you have to do is tell people that they have to demand their representatives in parliament for policies which encourage revitalization of soil. This is the only way we can survive.

Living through impacts of climate change mean action has to be immediate - there’s somewhere for that anxiety to be channeled, no matter how distressing.

Unpopular opinion perhaps. But the climate change message doesn’t resonate with a lot of people. Maybe it’s time to change our approach.,jolhar,60,u3vf2m,ExtinctionRebellion,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtinctionRebellion/comments/u3vf2m/unpopular_opinion_perhaps_but_the_climate_change/,25,"I’ve noticed a lot of people just don’t give a shit about the world warming a couple of degrees in a hundred years. They seem to think any discussion on the effects of this change is exaggeration or hysteria. I don’t think people understand how an increase in global temperature could effect them personally. They just don’t see how it could be that bad.

Lately I’ve changed my approach to discussing how exponential growth is unsustainable. Using fossil fuel that take millions of years to form but seconds to burn is not a viable way to support earths growing population. Etc etc. Giving specific examples. Discussing how it will directly impact daily life. How many things are dependent on fossil fuels, even things you wouldn’t expect like fertiliser and food.

I’ve found even climate change deniers admit that this is a problem and something needs to be done. The message might be different, but the desired effect is the same. Getting people thinking about reduced consumption and renewables. 

For the first time in a long time I feel like I’m getting somewhere. 

It’s disappointing that these people aren’t motivated enough to care about the climate. But I don’t think the message is important right now. It’s the results we need to focus on and if this is the way to get results so be it. We need to get the climate change deniers on board. We can worry about changing their views on the climate later.

**Advance Praise for Wild by Design**

  
“Can we repair the ecological damage that we’ve done? As Laura Martin observes, no question today could be more pressing, or more uncertain. Wild by Design is a fascinating book—far-reaching, deeply researched, and probing.”—**Elizabeth Kolbert, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future**

  
“This is a superb book. Laura Martin’s research takes us where no restoration literature has gone before, asking, ‘Who gets to decide where and how wildlife management occurs?’ Martin tackles this question with unmatched clarity and insight, illuminating the crucial discussions we must have to secure a future with thriving natural species and spaces.”—**Peter Kareiva, President and CEO, Aquarium of the Pacific**

  
“A brilliant intervention in the history of conservation that charts changes in ecological understanding of how landscapes rebound from disaster. In following the roots of restoration ecology, Martin explores how naturalness can be cultivated rather than found, providing us with seeds of hope in an age of climate despair.”—**Erika Lorraine Milam, author of Creatures of Cain: The Hunt for Human Nature in Cold War America**",1649867752.0,4,0,,[]

We - the United Kingdom - will be absolutely fine in terms of food production. \n\nThe level of ignorance you\'re displaying is staggering.\n\nFirstly, you should be aware that the UK imports a high proportion of its food, and the only way we can support the levels of food required to feed the whole UK population is to change our diets to eat more vegetables. Don\'t believe me?\n\nhttps://www.countryfile.com/news/can-the-uk-feed-itself-after-brexit/\n\n""How much food does the UK currently produce?\n\nThe UK grows 61% of the food it eats, according to the National Farming Union (NFU),Tim Lang, Professor of Food Policy at City, University of London, and DEFRA’s Agriculture in the UK paper (July 2017). Government sources sometimes quote a figure of 75% but this excludes ‘non-indigenous’ items such as exotic fruit – bananas and mangoes, tea, coffee and spices – foods that cannot be grown (either at all or on a meaningful scale) in the UK.""\n\n""Historically how much food has the UK produced?\n\nTo find the highest historical rates for self-sufficiency in Britain, you need to go back to the 18th century, according to Professor Lang. Historic modern-day lows include the eves of the First World War and Second World War, when we produced only around 33% of our food. The recent high was 82% in the early 1980s.""\n\n""Can the UK feed itself after Brexit?\n\nYES says Professor Tim Lang\n\n“Yes, but it depends on what we eat,” says Professor Tim Lang. “We’ll have to cut eating meat down to once a week. We have to rebuild our horticulture and put more money into primary food production. There has to be a shift in how we grow our food.”\n\nNorfolk-based Hodmedod’s, a British pulse and grain supplier and 2017 Food and Farming Award-winner, was asked by Transition Norwich to see if the city could become self-sufficient. “We looked at land use and nutrient requirements and calculated the city could feed itself with a six-mile hinterland,” says Josiah Meldrum, Hodmedod’s co-founder. “But this would require significant land use and dietary changes. It would mean eating less meat and eating the vegetable protein that would usually be grown for animals.”""\n\nSecondly, climate change is set to a massive impact on the stability of growing conditions for food, and with that instability comes reduced harvests. The more unstable our climate becomes, the less food we can grow in fields, meaning a transition to other forms of food production, a transition we\'re not prepared for as a country.\n\nAre you getting the picture now?\n\n> Who in the hell are YOU to deem what is and isn’t important to me and mine?\n\nSame question to you, sunshine.', 'LOL.

In Britain the seemingly permanent shortage of lorry drivers must be a mere minor bump. Quite rational, from their point of view, corporate hoarding of product when it will sell at 10% more in 3 days and 20% more in a week from now is irrelevant, right ? After all the corporations are holy and good, and they\'d never do such a thing. Consult a medium and call up the ghost of Margaret Thatcher, and she\'ll tell you just that. Gasoline you say. Understand that when the price goes up 10% or 20% the actual cost to all the daisy chain in the queue hasn\'t changed at all - because the product is mostly bought and sold on the futures market. \n\nAs for said futures market when the composite index goes from $98.26 to $94.61 in the course of the last day do you think that the price you pay at the pump will be close to 4% less depending on when you fill up ? When the price goes from $94.57 now to $89.87 in 2023 will you pay about 5% less or will the price remain the same or go up ?\n\nNow, I\' m sure that the occupations, some of which can last over 24 *hours* have had an effect. It\'s what they wanted, and they got it even if the immediate results of their actions are far less than either they or the gutter press imagine. The lorry driver shortage has had a similar effect on places over the past two *years*. *That* won\'t go away in a day or so. \n\nThe police **have** been sent in. The army **won\'t** be sent in because the government knows, the industry knows, people familiar with the industry know, I know, and anyone gifted with a memory and the capacity to pay attention knows that this particular speed bump will pass in a day or so, leaving the routine problem unsolved. \n\nMemory. Let\'s look. Yes, you have indeed seen this movie before. It\'s a [rerun from last September](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/26/grant-shapps-hits-out-at-manufactured-crisis-as-drivers-panic-buy). At that time the Secretary if State Grant Shapps called it a ""manufactured crisis"" and laid the blame on the trucking industry. \n\nThe immediate cause, of course, was the wave of panic buying that led to extensive line-ups at the pump which automatically drained the regular supply which can\'t be changed rapidly which meant - no gas at the pump. It\'s pretty predicable and reminiscent of the toilet paper shortage that wasn\'t 2 years ago. \n\nXR knows this. The industry knows this. XR knows this and depends on it. Whatever result their actions may achieve is magnified, 2X, 4X, 6X by the public panic. The industry and the government know this and depend on it. A minor blip in cash flow feeds ever increasing profit over the long term as profits go up and up and the price at the pump stays the same or also goes up and up. Their political friends and dependents know this and depend on it, hoping that they will be able to go on supporting their donors because much of the news is easily manipulated to deflect blame. \n\nThe more astute amongst XR also know this big picture. The present shortage will be one more reason to up the ante in this fixed game. Prices will rise. Future shortages due to many other causes will provide the justification for industry to continue filling its pockets and politicians to continue to warm seats in Westminster. As the income transfer to the rich and powerful continues it actually makes XR\'s arguments *more* convincing.\n\nHandled right by skillfully deflecting blame this fixed game can continue for a long, long time.

First of all there is *effectiveness*. The present consensus on this can be summed up by the following quote from said wiki:\n\n>Climate engineering approaches are sometimes viewed as potential complementary options for limiting climate change or its impacts, alongside reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation.[1] Scientists agree that solar geoengineering and carbon dioxide removal cannot substitute for reducing emissions. \n\nSo it isn't a magic bullet. Whether it has any utility as an auxiliary or secondary form of action is what the debate is about. It may have. It may not have. \n\nMore important, in my opinion, is the debate over the possible consequences of such action. \n\n>Because of insufficient research[7] there are large uncertainties regarding the effectiveness, side effects and potential unforeseen consequences. Most experts argue that the risks of such interventions must be seen in the context of the risks of dangerous climate change.[8][9] Interventions at large scale may run a greater risk of disrupting natural systems, resulting in a dilemma that those approaches that could prove highly cost-effective in addressing extreme climate risk, might themselves cause substantial risk.[8] \n\nThe bottom line on that subject is that once you drop that egg on the floor it *stays* broken. No saying 'sorry' and putting it back together again. If the effectiveness of schemes for climate modification are 'unknown', the consequences of such efforts are 'unknown^10'. So research on the subject should continue, but more than a slight amount of caution is warranted."", ""I agree with what you are saying. However I believe that a move towards HTF we are going to deal with mass migration, food shortages etc etc will help some fence sitters realise that this isn't a game.\n\nThe foil hatters will continue to buy foil and make new hats but the people between them and the people that realise what's going on may be swayed into Acton."", 'All well and good,  but we\'ve already radically geoengineered our climate... Might as well do it with intention, imo. Very very soon we will come to a point where we have the abstract ""oh this might be bad"" arguments on one side,  and literally millions dying on the other side. At that point, when a relatively small player (ie. spending billions to trillions) can unilaterally act to save themselves, its going to be tough to take a moral stance against them. Aside from that,  I must disagree with your egg metaphor - certain technological  are inherently reversible.', 'In terms of mass migration I would say that we are already well into the growth phase. The UN\'s [World Migration Report](https://worldmigrationreport.iom.int/wmr-2020-interactive/#:~:text=The%20current%20global%20estimate%20is,over%20the%20past%20five%20decades.) puts the present estimate of \'international\' (!!!) migrants at about 281 million. This fails to include the \'internally displaced\'. As can be seen from the bar graphs in this link the numbers in most parts of the world have basically doubled since 1990. These numbers will, of course, grow even more in the future. The estimate so far is that about [21.5 million people were displaced **each year**](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/report-impact-climate-change-migration-october-2021#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20one%20model%20forecasts%20that,has%20been%20mostly%20internal%20and) by ""sudden onset weather-related hazards between 2008 and 2016"". I feel comfortable in calling that ""mass"".\n\nSome of the migrants are, of course, fleeing war, but war isn\'t unconnected to climate change and adverse effects on agriculture. Syria, with perhaps the greatest number of displaced people in the world is a good example. See [How climate change paved the way to war in Syria](https://www.dw.com/en/how-climate-change-paved-the-way-to-war-in-syria/a-56711650). With or without war the climate is having an impact in many other places, Central America, the Sahel, South Asia, etc.. \n\nSo this particular crisis is already here. How has the world responded to it ? I\'d give a failing grade on that test. On terms of international migration the most common response has been to either block the migrants or lock them up. This isn\'t restricted to the United States and Europe. Amongst others Turkey and India stand out as vengeful hosts as well. \n\nNow it would indeed be nice if this effect (migration), and others,  would lead to public pressure to accelerate measures against climate change.

This looks specifically at Fridays for Future protests, but the results can also be used for all climate change protests. 

The potential of the results that the dissertation showed are great. They indicate that the stock market overall reacts **negatively** to the protests. Therefore, the financial market sees not only climate change, but protests against climate change as well, as uncertain which leads to the negative 'abnormal returns'. **These findings imply that the protests are not just having a long term impact, but a direct short term impact against publicly traded companies.**

Protestors are having an immediate impact on the value of these publicly traded companies by protesting.

But he adds: “It is an utter necessity why I am here.”\n\nMr Rose says he wants MPs to receive the same presentation from top scientists that Boris Johnson did on the climate crisis - and which reportedly caused the prime minister to re-examine beliefs and take the emergency seriously.\n\nThe editor of Carbon Brief, who published the slides, told The Independent most of them were “101 climate science”. They included graphs on rising sea levels, increasing global temperatures and the impacts of a warmer world - including floods, heatwaves and wildfires.\n\nEditor Leo Hickman said: “It is surprising really that it took quite this long for him to have his own personal epiphany on climate change. But it’s also reassuring that, when he was finally presented with these facts by the UK’s leading scientists, then he sat up and publicly committed to taking this issue seriously.”\n\nMr Rose says he wants this briefing - led by Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser who also led Covid presentations - to be available for broadcast to the public.\n\n“It’s a very simple ask,” he says.\n\nMr Rose, originally from South Africa but who has lived in London for two decades, claims this request has been rejected so far on the basis information on this topic is already availale.\n\nThe slideshow believed to have sparked Mr Johnson’s “road to Damascus” moment on the climate crisis were in\n fact made public by Freedom of Information request and published earlier this year.\n\n    Slide show which convinced Johnson climate crisis is real in 2019 ‘show PM lacked basic knowledge when elected’\n\nBut Mr Rose wants more; he is worried people may not engage with the wealth of information and reports available by themselves. “I'm looking for improved understanding. And that comes through a briefing, that is maybe no more than an hour and a half.”\n\nThe 52-year-old software engineer is now getting ready to spend potentially weeks more on hunger strike while waiting to hear if his demands will be met.\n\nAt this point, he says he has lost all interest in food to the point where passers-by taunting him with doughnuts and sweets does not bother him.\n\nBut he has noticed the difference in himself. He tells The Independent he lacks energy in the morning and has lost 1st 5lb since he started his strike.\n\n“I’m just carrying on. And my life is at risk,” he says.\n\n“But what led me to this point is it is more important for the uncle to break than the future of my nephew and niece to be imperiled.”\n\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has been approached for comment."", 'Thanking ye']"

At 4°C of global warming, for example, it is estimated that the Earth won't be able to provide food to more than 1 billion people (lots of uncertainty). So that means that if we go there the human population will drop by 6 billion. It doesn't mean 6 billion people will die, many will due to famine and wars and future pandemics, but mostly it will be the fertility rate dropping. That won't be pretty.\n\nThat's kind of the worst-case scenario. \n\nHowever, I do believe that we will still have all of those just that their intensity will depend on us as a society. Will we succeed in burning down capitalism and authoritarian governments or not? How fast will we stop using fossil fuels?
