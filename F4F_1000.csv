She is just splitting the movement', 'Israel-Palestine is really much less gray than what a lot of people are making it out to be.

Do you think that she\'s actually want to ethnically cleanse Jews from the Levant or are you just peddling a right-wing dog whistle? ""Just asking questions""? ""Just concerned""?\n\nSorry if I\'m blunt, I just don\'t see what the argument or angle is here.', ""I'm personally in favor of a peace treaty that would ensure that Israelis and Palestinians live together in the Levant and all holy sites would be accessible to everyone (which doesn't matter to non-religious people like me but is a major sticking point for many who are involved), and hardliners on both sides (those who believe they deserve exclusive control of the area) put me off.\n\nRight now, FFF is very vulnerable to those who want to hijack the movement into supporting hardline pro-Palestine stances. I don't believe she supports ethnic cleansing but a good portion of those who agree with her current pro-Palestine stance seem to believe that Israelis aren't native to the area and that they need to be sent back to Europe."", "">  I don't believe she supports ethnic cleansing but a good portion of those who agree with her current pro-Palestine stance seem to believe that Israelis aren't native to the area and that they need to be sent back to Europe.\n\nThis is just speculation, I don't know how to engage with this.

Mostly in line with the ""ReFi"" movement (stands for Regenerative Finance) I've found some cool projects that are using it for good.

My brother (a game designer) and I came up with a concept to test this hypothesis. For our MVP, we launched an NFT collection that gives you access to an educational videogame and a virtual tour of [Senda Verde](https://sendaverde.org), a wildlife sanctuary in Bolivia (where we are from), where the proceeds go directly to the wildlife project. We chose a blockchain that has a clean carbon footprint and want to make it open source so that more projects can benefit from this - maybe even beyond wildlife (Senda Verde has a really cool rewilding project as well!)

Here's the link to try it out: [wildfriends.xyz](https://wildfriends.xyz)

They would spend a whole segment just talking about the “climate saboteurs” and drag the rest of us — researchers and technologists — down with them.\n\nNow that we passed the r/InflationReductionAct, the hardest part is over. The largest historical emitter has secured funding and policy to actually make change. While we are still waiting for BRICS (pollutes more than the entire west combined) to follow our lead, we have to give them an off ramp that is palatable. We are negotiating with them, mostly, not so much the fossil fuel companies anymore.\n\nImagine you’re an Indian or Chinese person who is reliant on Russian natural gas to drive to work and eat food every day. Some pink-haired feminist from the EU is gluing their hand to the oil pipeline to prevent you — the developing world — from developing into an economy like Europe. \n\n#The global south portrays this type of activism as oppression.\n\nThey don’t necessarily care about climate change if they are just trying to eat and pursue happiness. But in the west, where happiness is abundant, we are “privileged” to have decarbonization as an option.\n\nTherefore, the only pragmatic path forward in this geopolitical reality is technological innovation.

Power lines are unpopular, and that is why such an effort would be worthwhile.\n\nFFF could campaign for nuclear, one of the statistically safest forms of energy production. Not popular, but that is why the effort would be worthwhile.\n\nWhen/if you damage hydrocarbon infrastructure that can only inflate the cost of existing fuel reserves. Prices of commodities rise very quickly as soon as supply is constrained. The current record profits enjoyed by oil companies are an example of this. Russia’s oil and gas is (partially) off the market, and the cost of those commodities skyrocketed as a result.\n\nI’m personally glad Russian/Germany pipelines were destroyed, but only because that removed Russian leverage over Europe. It did not stop Europe from burning hydrocarbons and rather Germany has restarted coal plants. (While continuing to shutter nuclear plants.)\n\nI’m not in any energy sector.

Sounds pretty clickbaitish.', 'The word “capitalist” has been perverted.\n\nIf you asked Adam Smith and Karl Marx what capitalism is, they would give you two different definitions.\n\nCapitalism is, put simply, “private ownership” of commodities. The “free enterprise” aka “free market” economics is when privately owned businesses, without *complete* but some times limited government intervention, compete for the consumer choice. That lowers the costs.\n\nThe problem is not capitalism or the free enterprise. The problem is deregulation and the dismantling of the gold standard. Before the 70s, we actually had a decent shot of reversing climate change, but then we invaded Vietnam based on fake intel and created an oil-backed fiat currency to pay for it. \n\nWhen we make the climate movement an “anti-capitalist” movement, we actually discredit it in the eyes of moderates and republicans who we need to get on board. Without their support, there is no climate action. The largest political funding of climate action — the r/InflationReductionAct — only passed because of the bipartisan attempts.\n\nI made this analogy before with a car crash. There are 3 options.\n\n- (inaction) we do nothing and crash into a car at high speed. The airbags deploy but it’s really bad.\n\n- (misguided action) we swerve out of the way and run off a cliff, avoiding the crash, but creating another, far worse outcome.\n\n- (delayed action) we slam on the brakes knowing we are going to crash, but it’s like a fender bender and maybe you break a headlight.\n\nClearly, delayed action is better than no action. The problem is that people are misguided into thinking there is no geopolitical cliff of dismantling capitalism. You want to dismantle capitalism and the US hegemony? Okay, China and Russia take over. Do you think their communist governments will establish green building codes? Fuck no. China pollutes more than the west combined and Russia literally invaded Ukraine so they could steal their offshore oil and shale reserves.\n\nIt’s time to accept the inevitable crash. There is no soft landing off a cliff. 1.5 is not happening. 2.5 might with diplomacy to get China and Russia to hold hands with us. If we dismantle the free markets under the strawman of libertarian absolutism, there is no climate action, only war.', 'Sounds like James Burk Connections for the uninitiated.

Fighting Against Misinformation in the Renewable Energy Sector,Suuperdad,9,10zqgey,FridaysForFuture,https://youtu.be/kLl8yEW1q-8,1,,1676130405.0,9,0,,"['Sometimes we think in isolation. We do this the most with our energy options. \n\nWind kills birds. \n\nHydro kills fish. \n\nCoal pollutes the air and water. \n\nNatural gas emits methane. \n\nSolar has waste and cobalt/lithium mining issues. \n\nNuclear waste is scary and it takes a long time to build a new plant. \n\nThese lines of thinking all lead to one conclusion - we shouldn\'t have any electricity. This is called the Utopian Fallacy. If a solution isn\'t perfect, we shouldn\'t do it. I find permaculturists especially get a real kick out of feeling morally superior for hating on the above, using that rationale, but remain in la-la-land without any real world solutions.\n\nIf there was a perfect solution, this wouldn\'t even be a topic. Unfortunately for us, we live in the real world, and we need to design power systems. When power goes out, people die. It\'s that simple. \n\nA temporary power outage, if sustained, can kill hundreds or thousands of people within a few days. What happens when entire society sees long term and possibly permanent energy crisis\'? \n\nWhat happens when countries all around the world figure out, collectively at the same time, that to phase out coal oil and gas, they need 3 to 10 times the power generation (i.e. removing coal = electrifying transportation = TONS more power needed). What happens when all countries try to hire the same labour force, try to engage the same vendors, to build the same products? ""Sure, we can meet that order, you are country 79 on the list, and we should have your order completed in roughly 40 years"". There is going to be a RACE for renewables. It will be the war of the future. Who gets the vendors to build them the power they need. \n\nSo lets flatten that out, and get started now.\n\nThat requires dispelling myths and misinformation. \n\nA large part of the solution is absolutely going to be to try to reduce consumption in all ways possible. However, our current energy situation on planet earth is that 84% of our energy comes from Fossil Fuels (https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix).\n\nTo replace fossil fuels isn\'t a question of IF. It\'s a question of WHEN. They are non renewables. They emit carbon (and don\'t forget OTHER waste also). We are sitting at 420ppm CO2 right now. You may think that CO2 isn\'t bad. That plants grow faster. So what is okay then? 840ppm? 1680ppm? 16800ppm? The reality is that it\'s going up 2.5 to 3ppm every year, accelerating, AND THAT MEANS THAT TREES ARE NOT CAPABLE OF REMOVING WHAT WE ARE PUTTING OUT, or it would be going down. And at SOME POINT, if it keeps going up, we won\'t be able to breathe. It\'s already making us sick (see in video). So to say it\'s not a problem, is delusion.\n\nWe HAVE to get off them, because they are, by very definition, a non-renewable resource. \n\nFor the economists out there - ask yourself what happens to the global economy if 84% of the energy running it disappears. Even if you think CO2 emissions don\'t matter, we still have to replace fossil fuels before we run out, even just to save the economy and prevent the collapse of civilization as we know it.\n\nPermaculture isn\'t THE solution. But it can be part of the solution. Why? We could stop injustice in the world, transition all farms to permaculture farms, and pat ourselves on our backs, but once coal, oil and gas run out, society would utterly collapse and not in a good way. Death, starvation, riots. \n\nWhen people starve, they destroy the environment to feed their families. \n\nRenewable energy is the soft landing pad that will help us pull the economy into the realm of sustainability. Then, regenerative practices like permaculture can restore our earth. This isn\'t the ""new world order"". This isn\'t ""the grand design"". This isn\'t ""the great reset"".\n\nThis is just humans reacting to inevitability. \n\nSo why is there such a big misinformation campaign to prevent building the very Noah\'s ark that we KNOW we need? In one word: Greed. In another: Corruption. But lets debunk some of their BS, shall we?\n\nOr more succinctly, in 3 words: Fk Rupert Murdoch.\n\n(All sources provided in video.)']"

The green-building-expert user commenting here, who’s calling these ideas terrorism-by-association, seems to be reacting from an ideological and emotional commitment to capitalism and free-market solutions, and would probably benefit from a really big hug and some deep breathing. \n\nExcept for explicitly blaming capitalism for the ecological catastrophe, every problem and recommendation in the video aligns with the 2021-2022 IPCC reports. There are literally zero references to violence in the video, other than the violence required by hyperindustrial capitalism. There are certainly no suggestions that violence is needed to transform our economy and undo the damage to our planet. \n\nGreat video, IMO. \n\nI’m no keyboard warrior, and may not have time to respond to any (anticipated) personal attacks.', 'Here’s a reality check from your friendly Washington green building researcher.\n\n#Degrowth ideology is designed to make climate action look bad and ultimately prevent the green transition. \n\nThe “carbon footprint” was designed with the word “foot” in mind by Exxon Mobile to distract us away from the corporate *producer* of emissions and onto the choiceless *consumer* of emissions. Talk about clever accounting tricks, how about clever semantic tricks? It is a quantitative argument that says use less plastic, reduce, reuse and recycle…. \n\n- Rather than design a “better” plastic out of algae and switchgrass\n\n- rather than design a “better” cotton or concrete or paper out of hemp\n\n- rather than design a “better” beef with rotational carbon sequestering grazing and no agrochemicals \n\n- rather than design a “better” steel with sustainably sourced cross laminated timber \n\n- rather than design a “better” car that is faster and cheaper to maintain \n\n… and ride a bicycle instead? In the snow and heat of summer? So we are supposed to go on a diet to save the planet? So it’s my fault and not Exxon’s fault or the Chinese Communist Party’s fault?\n\nAccording to a former logistics expert at a previous White House administration, the “degrowth” ideology is economically a permanent recession. The entire national security apparatus takes these people and frames them for various crimes because they are a threat to the “fairytales of infinite growth” of John Maynard Keynes and MMT. Before 1971, the dollar was backed by gold, then Nixon and Kissinger established the fiat currency of the petro-dollar where oil was traded in dollars. But John Maynard Keynes was a socialist. It’s a very complicated issue and infinite economic growth is only possible if we *decouple* economy from *environmental* destruction by using vernacular building materials like above. You can still grow the economy and population but only if you can do so without destroying ecosystems with fertilizer, glyphosate and carbon emissions. In the UK, degrowth is funded by the Russians and are designed to make all climate activists look bad, if not, make Europe dependent on Russian natural gas.\n\nIf you actually want to solve climate change in the *reality* we live in and not some utopia, then green economic growth is the only way. Green growth is not greenwashing and painting things green — it is literally making bricks out of hemp, making plastic out of algae and making aviation fuel from grass. Green growth means shitty businesses polluting everywhere will fail and responsible businesses using green materials will make a profit. Green growth is a carbon tax, essentially, incentivizing innovation and punishing pollution.\n\nThe only degrowth argument that is worth while is population degrowth specifically in China and India. China pollutes more than the entire west combined, a majority of global carbon emissions. China used more concrete in 3 years than the USA used in 100 years. So China needs degrowth like the 1 child policy, but now they’re going in the opposite direction because political ideology.\n\nWhen we look at rednecks in the USA driving a pickup truck, personal vehicles are less than 10% of global emissions and buildings are 40%. And then add to the fact that China pollutes multiple times more than the USA, then it’s like… why should Americans do anything at all if China is willing to invade the South China Sea to steal oil? They continue to open coal factories while we are being told to eat bugs and ride a bike? \n\nLook at some pie charts. This “degrowth” ideology is delusional. It demands a complete ignorance of geopolitics and statistics. Nobody is going to stop driving or stop eating. We cannot change consumer culture unless you want some authoritarian takeover like Mao, Stalin or Hitler — they liked degrowth.\n\nBut we can design *better* products by reclaiming capitalism to its original anti-feudalist intent.\n\nThat’s what the Build Back Better agenda is about: free market innovation.\n\nThe real greenwashing is offering solutions that would never happen without violent revolutions. That’s disingenuous. Green Growth is the only peaceful way to mitigate climate change.', 'TL;DR:\n\n#This video incorrectly blames climate change on capitalism. \n\nIt correctly notes that capitalism is defined as “private ownership of means of production” but then incorrectly amends this definition with growthism, colonialism, planned obsolescence and basically anything wrong with the world. It is scapegoating capitalism in a rhetoric that echoes Nazi and Communist ideology. When Obama placed a large cookie in a skinny glass of milk and it couldn’t make contact — this author would blame capitalism. If this author is a virgin — he would blame capitalism. Doing bad on the ACT science section — he would blame capitalism.\n\nWhen bringing up concepts like r/GreenCapitalism, there is no proper rebuttal, just a sort of “oh that doesn’t work”.\n\nThere is no etymology of the word capitalism. \n\nThere is no reference of Adam Smith and the Wealth of Nations. \n\nThere is no reference of the 1971 suspension of the gold standard or MMT. \n\nThere is no reference of actual proven “dumb” technologies as noted in my other comment.\n\nAnyone who is educated enough to read the peer review science of the greenhouse effect should also be capable of spotting the BS in this presentation.

No one mentioned other countries. Or that the free market is a full sail good or bad. Again you’re trying to be black and white, or good or bad, when there are shades of gray.', 'I hope you excuse me but your opinion about the western political system is very much divorced of reality. \n\nFirst of all the politicians are corruptible and most of the times they don’t follow public opinion, but the desires of their donors. That means money controls politics. It is indeed the case that rash decisions which go against their donors (not those who elected them) will lead to career suicide. Most of the times politicians get elected because there are no other options or the other options are way less desirable. So people can’t even choose those politicians which have the same opinion as them.\n\nSecond of all, you assume (I believe) an ideally educated and informed public. This is not the case, though. The public can be manipulated and misinformed. Climate change denial started in 1970s and it’s quite well documented that oil companies worked to change public opinion. Climate change denial wasn’t here in 1980s and if the politicians would have done what the public wanted in 1980s we would have been a long way off into fixing this. Now we have a large proportion of people who don’t believe climate change is real. That misinformation program was very effective. Heck, it used to not even be a political issue whether climate change is real.\n\nThird of all, we have all the tools we need to fight climate change now, and we also don’t have time to wait for any scientific advancements. It’s true that most of the emissions come from industry, and we need the government to push those industries to change their processes. We haven’t even decarbonised our energy production and there have been very little political pressure to do it. There are huge amounts of methane released to the atmosphere from the natural gas extraction. It would be costly for the natural gas extraction companies to fix their pipes and valves and monitoring, so they lobby the government to not even talk about it. And methane is 100 times more potent than CO2 in the first 10 years of its release. \n\nAnd last point, democracy doesn’t mean „majority rules“. There are systems in democracies to fight the dictatorship of the majority. For people of 70 years and above, climate change will have minimal impact, while those younger than 40 will have a very difficult time. Theoretically the desires of younger people should have more weight in this decision since they will bear the brunt of climate change.\n\nIn any case, we’ve known about climate change for more than 50 years and our governments have done very little to fight it. Our governments are following the desires of their donors not of their constituents and delay action. Climate change has evolved almost to the point where we have to throw capitalism away to survive as a society. I don’t find it at all exaggerate when people throw everything and the kitchen sink at trying to force the system to act. \n\nI warmly recommend the podcast Drilled by Amy Westervelt.

But let’s not draw sweeping generalizations either. \n\nConservatism used to mean the gold standard, which was dismantled for the neo-liberal petrodollar fiat currency. The petrodollar was used to fight the Cold War, but now it has only exacerbated the Cold War into a shooting war in Ukraine. Printing money forever is not fiscal conservatism and that’s why it was banned in the US constitution, which specifically mentioned gold and silver, not oil. All Nixon/Reagan did was deregulate the economy and destroy the planet — that’s the opposite of *conserve*atism. The meatpacking industry is owned by mostly 4 companies — how on earth do people think the Nixon deregulation is somehow a right wing conservative policy? Right wing means less government intervention, not a merging of corporations with the state! \n\nBut this sentiment is true that the right is no longer right and they don’t even know it. President Bill Clinton balanced the budget, eliminating the federal debt, and the “conservative” party spent trillions on a war for oil — who is the true Conservative Party? The democrats, the ones funding the green transition. That’s why it’s called the r/InflationReductionAct — because the green transition is good for conserving stability in the economy and ignoring climate change is extremely bad for the economy. \n\n>”fascism … merger of state and corporate power”\n\nAbsolutely. The anti-capitalists love big crony corporations and hate small businesses. This merger reduces free market competition and private ownership, making it easy to control people from the top down, removing their freedoms. In Nazi Germany for example, they had a quota for how many items had to be produced, not based on the market but some arbitrary formalism, which ultimately led to shortages.\n\n> “fascism takes the problems of capitalism and puts it on other people”\n\nWhat is capitalism? Can anyone define capitalism? Even my college history professors could not define capitalism. People think that capitalism is just a profit hunger and nothing more — that is a perversion.\n\nThe term was coined by Adam Smith in *The Wealth of Nations* where he essentially opposes the top-down tyranny of feudal lords. Capitalism = anti-fascism. To oppose this consolidated control structure, also known as a state monopoly, he proposed the “free enterprise” system also known as a free market. It is this competition that drives the market to select the cheapest, most efficient goods. As a result, democracy became available. \n\nIn practice, crony corrupt consolidation has led to a deregulation of the market so people cheat the free market and dump pollution wherever just to gain more profits. But the problem isn’t the competition of entities, small or large, but the lack of regulations and monopolistic consolidation.\n\nPresident Biden, who *passed the largest climate change legislation to fund the largest green transition EVER in human history*, has a slogan “capitalism without competition is not capitalism” to echo this sentiment. Corporate monopolies like Monsanto and Cargill are not capitalist — they are anti-capitalist. Historically, the communist are the worst for the environment — look at the Aral Sea. Today, it is the Communist Party that leads the world in coal exports and the former KGB Putin who weaponizes natural gas monopolies. Monopolies = Soviet natural gas. If Germany had a free market of options — Nuclear, solar, wind, LNG, shale — then the green transition would have been easier to remove LNG and Shale later on. But they got rid of Nuclear, LNG, Shale, instead relying on the former Soviet monopoly of gas.', '[deleted]', '(2/2)\n\n> “the problem isn’t capitalism it’s these brown people over here”\n\nThe subtext of this statement is that capitalism is inherently racist. In a recent speech, Vladimir Putin, who did his PhD on natural gas exports, uses this same exact “capitalism is racist” rhetoric to garner support against the west and ultimately against the green transition. The notion that “capitalism is racist” is designed to divide us by race so we cannot unite by environmental stewardship. Whenever people say “capitalism is racist” they are helping Vladimir Putin and his natural gas monopoly in Europe, they are helping the CCP export coal. \n\nUnder the guise of a r/GreenMarshallPlan, the west WILL pay for the green transition in developing nations for free, using IMF funding and corporate taxes to repair the damage done over the last 100 years, with no strings attached. That sounds pretty anti-racist to me. But, Putin calls the Jewish president a “Nazi” so he who smelt it dealt it.\n\n\n> “too many babies”\n\nThomas Malthus predicted that the finite reality of round earth could not sustain an exponentially growing population. He graphed the linear supply increase with the exponential demand increase, highlighting their intersection as a “crisis” point such as what we are witnessing right now. \n\nThe soil moisture deficit spreads due to over-farming and reliance on nitrate/phosphate/potassium fertilizers that damage the soil, just like it did in Eden before it became Baghdad. Putin has timed his war in Ukraine to reduce wheat exports at this critical juncture where we begin to fix the planet, in an attempt to maximize the economic pain, essentially, creating a much larger famine had he proposed peace and diplomacy.\n\nThat being said, more than 50% of global carbon emissions come from China, who has stated openly it was “humiliated” by not being as developed as the west. The CCP has stated its intention to invade Taiwan and continue coal exports while occupying the South China Sea for its oil reserves. Simultaneously, the Indian economy justifiably wants to develop as well, and you cannot blame anyone for that. However, that’s 3 billion people right there. There’s 300 million in the USA. So when 3,000,000,000 people purchase AC units, eat beef and drive cars all at once, that will have a larger mathematical impact than the USA, which is 10% of their population and is reducing its emissions. That’s just the same math which identified the greenhouse effect in the first place.\n\nTherefore, because of their understandable quest for development, a pursuit of happiness, we are locked in to a 1.5 perhaps even 2.0 degree increase, unless the west funded their green growth. If the west doesn’t fund their green growth, then a war will break out between China and India in a fight for water of the Tibetan Plateau, while the rest of the world deals with melting ice caps and regular extreme weather events.\n\nBut this guy is trying to sensationalize this nuanced reality and say that anyone who talks about Malthusian economics is racist. In order to pay for their green transition, we have to speak the reality of math: their inevitable population growth and development could make our transition pointless, taking us well beyond a 2 degree scenario. We can still grow the population without using more resources, but we need expensive green technologies like indoor farms, desalination and renewable energy to do that. They can’t afford it without us paying for it, so that’s what we need to do.\n\n> “the right has been doing a great job of taking the language of the left and using it to feed a base of very angry, pissed off people who then start to blame the wrong people for their problem.”\n\nThis is exactly true. Every misinformation campaign I’ve witnessed, and there are many I’ve studied, usually take a “sliver of truth” and wrap the truth in lies.\n\nIn this case, the republicans lost their jobs due to the blowback of globalism, which was a peace treaty of economic entanglement that lowered costs for consumers. They lost their jobs because slave workers in China were cheaper, but then they blamed blacks and Mexicans instead of Nixon, who established the petrodollar.\n\n> “if you *don’t* want to be owned by corporations… then you are a socialist”\n\nNo. That’s misinformation. You are not a socialist for rejecting the tyranny of feudalism, corporatism, monopolies, monarchy or authoritarianism. Capitalism was literally designed so that regular people could “privately own the means of production” which Marx had intended to make public. Small business are the backbone of capitalism, while large corporations like Cargill and Monsanto, who use their bought out politicians to consolidate power and eliminate regulations, are anti-capitalist. They are literally merging with the state, in some cases, making it illegal to power your own home with solar or feed yourself with your own seeds.\n\n“Late stage capitalism” is a made up term by communists who wanted to create a self fulfilling prophecy of capitalism not working. The reality is that capitalism, private ownership, does not come in stages — it is black and white. Either you own your own business or the government tells you how many products to make and allocates the land to whomever it chooses.\n\nSo when Blackstone or all of these big corporations are buying homes during the pandemic, they are reducing the ability of the economy to have small businesses, essentially, dismantling capitalism by hoarding real estate and creating inflation bubbles.', '###[View link](https://redditsave.com/info?url=/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/xpv5en/ecofascism_summarized/)\n\n\n --- \n [**Info**](https://np.reddit.com/user/SaveVideo/comments/jv323v/info/)&#32;|&#32; [**Feedback**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Kryptonh&subject=Feedback for savevideo)&#32;|&#32;[**Donate**](https://ko-fi.com/getvideo) &#32;|&#32; [**DMCA**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Kryptonh&subject=Content removal request for savevideobot&message=https://np.reddit.com//r/FridaysForFuture/comments/xpv5en/ecofascism_summarized/)', 'I think the statement about ""brown people"" was referring to Eco fascism, not capitalism.\n\nWasn\'t malthusianism proven wrong as the world population is set to peak soon?\n\nAs for your final paragraph, it is precisely free market capitalism that is allowing these companies to hoard real estate. So it doesn\'t make sense to me to say they are dismantling capitalism, they are just moving it into  its final stage in that market section', '>”free market capitalist allows hoarding of real estate”\n\nPlease read *The Wealth of Nations* by Adam smith. Please.\n\nCapitalism was created IN OPPOSITION to the consolidation control controversy of feudalism. You are trying to redefine capitalism as the very thing it was created to oppose. Malarkey detected, malarkey rejected.\n\n>”final stage”\n\nThe private ownership of the means of production does not come in “stages”. That is complete misinformation you are spreading into the climate groups. Is your intention to decarbonize or to help people question our movement? You are doing us a disservice by making environmentalism into a critique about capitalism, which you cannot even define.\n\nYou know who else hated capitalism? Literal fascists.', 'Guess I must be a literal fascist then *shrug*.  \n\nYou are being deliberately obtuse. How are monopolies that abuse their workers and shut down all competition, like Amazon, not ironically similar to feudalism?', 'Yeah you are trying to normalize anti-capitalist rhetoric. What is your solution then without capitalism? How does that help decarbonize? \n\nCan you even define what capitalism is in your own words? Then, by a dictionary? \n\n> “how are monopolies who shut down competition and abuse their workers not “ironically” similar to feudalism”\n\nThey are feudalism, that’s my point. Fuedalism is not capitalism. Capitalism is anti-feudalism. Communism in theory even distribution but in practice it never works because corruption always plagues the people in charge of re-distributing the money. Socialism was the economic system of choice for Fascist Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. They literally were a corporatist state the opposed free-markets and abolished private property.\n\nWhy are you trying to redefine capitalism as a boogeyman? Capitalism means you own stuff — socialism/communism/fascism means you don’t own stuff. Without private ownership and free markets, it will be require an extremely bloody revolution to decarbonize, one that will likely result in nuclear war, and then you can forget about climate change.\n\nCapitalist green economic growth with technology change is the only anti-racist and pragmatic path forward.

Now that the climate strike has changed geopolitics, what are occupations moving forward to decarbonize and adapt? Not just for her, but also for those she’s inspired as well. Then, which degrees, if needed, would support those occupations? Has Greta named a career path yet or mentioned a focus in school?

In no particular order:

- Architecture and real estate is 40% of global carbon emissions but is mostly suitable for artistic STEM types who are good with puzzles. Rem Koolhaas came from journalism, so you don’t have to be STEM, but it’s correlated. Until we figure out sustainable building supply chains, however, we have more architects than sustainable building materials, but that will change shortly.

- Law and politics is the key bottleneck for enforcing building codes, regulations and lawsuits. We need an army of green lawyers to write and prosecute green law. 

- Urban Planning is the intersection of the built environment and law. Zoning laws will be needed to balance healthy economic growth with decarbonization goals.

- Mechanical engineering and industrial design is needed to create the tools and technologies to electrify our world of the future. They will create green building materials for buildings, cars, trains, electric bikes, tools and clothing.

- Farming and forestry is needed to protect the soil from erosion, over-farming and irreversible deforestation. We need lumber as a building material but only if it protects the potassium in the ground. Indoor farms and carbon-sinking forrests will be a major component of GHG reductions.

- Accounting and business are more generalist occupations that will be needed everywhere no matter what. This extends into sustainability consultants and advisors.

- Journalism and media roles are needed to lubricate the transition to skeptics and luddites. Many people will actually like the future but need to have the anti-green misinformation untangled from their minds in a way that is not draconian or imposing, but empathetic to the daily struggles of normal people. This includes acting, music, opera singers and other influential figures.

- Chemistry and hard science will play hyper-focused roles with massive macro-economic implications. Silicon efficiency, battery capacity, concrete strength and aerodynamic efficiency are all impacted by chemistry. The climate science, however, is mostly established, so it’s not like we need to re-discover the empirically observed data.

Of course there are many in between all of these that are more specific, but these are the occupations that one could prepare for in college.",1663165144.0,5,0,,"['Technically she already has an honour degree from UBC', 'How do I get an “honorary” degree? Dang']"

In the 2020\'s, it abysmal results that any country have less than 50% of their power coming from low carbon sources.', 'Actually, it will be more difficult for FFF to archieve anything in germany. They uninvited a Singer because ""her hairstyle does not fit her origin"" - and that is a violation of her right on her own body, because of that the public opinion on FFF is going down.', ""ahh, so that's what that was about. I only saw the article as a side note and thought ok, I'm not gonna read this. It's so stupid when the climate movement sabotages itself because of what it sees as political correctness."", ""I mean it's easy for the media to denunciate an organization that doesn't have a PR committee. But imo only a bad medium would do this. It would also be interesting to learn about the reasons for this ongoing denunciations."", 'Exactly. FFF should be about climate. Maybe this should be communicated internally for damage control, there is a shitstorm going on right now. And for good reason.', 'The media did not do any of this. The FFF Landesverband Hannover did that themselves. And after being asked what this is about they released a statement, confirming this situation. This Information comes directly from FFF Hannover.\n\nThey use FFF for their own right-wing agenda.', ""I mean, it is a decision for a medium to write this kind of stuff that could be a sidenote otherwise. I agree with you saying that FFF should beabout the climate and nothing else. But I don't understand what you mean with right wing agenda."", 'I mean this whole ""cultures should not mix"" topic. Cultural apropiation. Some bubble try to sell this as left agenda while it clearly is right agenda. There is a true core - all people should have the same privileges - but to archieve that they try to fight discrimination with more discrimination. Thats is as if we would fight pollution with more pollution. That does not work. It is not enough to always point at other people and say them they have to question their own agenda, we have to question or own agenda too. If people stop questioning their own agenda we end in a situation like we see with cultural apropiation: A left wing idea as a base, but a right wing execution as result. And now these people try to missuse FFF to push this agenda. This brings a lot of us in difficult situations. I for example are explaining covid-protesters why it is not ok to demonstrate together with fascists for two years - if i would protest for FFF as i used to right now while FFF Hannover uses FFF for their right wing agenda i would be in no way different. I cant just ignore that. And yes, it is just a small group, but other FFF groups seems to be ok with that, otherwise there would some kind of distancing statement. As it stands now, it will be a lot harder for FFF to convince anyone in germany in the future.', ""You definitively have a point. I was for some time involved with the diversity department in Extinction Rebellion Berlin and some people there were pushing the BiPoC-Agenda really hard. I don't think that FFF is exactly like that as it is less radical and more rooted in the centre of society but I also feel like these movements are being used for other agendas. It always annoyed me a lot that we ended up talking about these topics more than the environment itself. Then again it was a diversity group so it was the right place to discuss these things, I guess. But I also don't understand why these people point the finger at others when they want to get rid of discrimination. So stupid."", 'Today i discovered that one FFF-Group did distance themselves from FFF-Hannover. Now they have their own shitstorm from the ""BiPoC-Bubble"" and some other FFF-Groups telling them they should not be part of the movement. So there are groups who still think FFF should be about climate, but there are also other FFF-Groups who think FFF is about cultural apropiation. I am still not sure what to make out of this.']"

Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using “overnight” costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes. If these trimmed costs are included, nuclear-generated electricity can be shown roughly 6 times more expensive than most studies claim.

The Epitome of GreenStockMarket? - Nel Hydrogen,NerdyNerdstein,18,pazyh9,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/pazyh9/the_epitome_of_greenstockmarket_nel_hydrogen/,1,"You ever wondered whether there is a ""green"" investment opportunity? I mean like really ""green"", not like ""our company has a 'social responsible department' and because of that we are sustainable""-green, but more like ""producing, storing and fuelling renewable energies plus develop the vehicles to use it""? The field of renewable energies is dominanted by big players whose workethics and participations do not quite hit the definition of a clean company. Therefore, the investor who cares about sustainability must turn to smaller companies that meet these criteria.
 
As one of the Mods of r/NelASA I want to talk to you about such a company: Norwegian hydrogen specialist ""Nel"". And just to be clear, the subreddit I moderate is no official Nel-subreddit. You can look at it more like a fanpage where information and news about the company and its stock are collected and discussed. Furthermore it's a place for enthusiasts and worldimprovers and Memes are a welcome contribution. First of all this is no financial/investment advice or purchase recommendation. This is just for your information and my own opinion.


ABOUT THE COMPANY

Let's talk about Nel (ASA is short for ""Aktiengesellschaft""). Founded in 1927 the company specialized in clean hydrogen production (by water electrolysers), storage and fuelling (via H2-Stations) and is the European market leader in ""purely green"" hydrogen today. To explain how they do it I can only recommend their innovative website to you. Take a look for yourself. It's worth it, I promise!

https://nelhydrogen.com/hydrogen/

Their cooperations include companies like Danish Everfuel / H2-Logic, and American Nikola / ProtonOnSite. Since 2016 the HYBRIT initiative, a cooperation between SwedishSteel, Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara and Vattenfall, has been pursuing the goal of producing the first fossil-free steel on the market on an industrial scale by 2026. To get there they use a Nel-electrolyzer. If fully implemented, there would be an energy requirement of 55 TerraWatt and a lot more electolyzers will be needed. With PowerCell Sweden and HexagonComposite Nel founded “HYON” in 2017, a joint venture with the aim of establishing fuel cell-powered vehicles in the maritime sector an cover the increasing hydrogen demand in Norwgian ports. In June 2021 SagaPureASA joined the collaboration, too. But recent cooperations are worth a closer look as well:

- Cooperation between Nel and FIRST SOLAR to produce cost efficient hydrogen -> 1,5 $ per kg (05/2021)

- Collaboration for a fossilefree hydrogen facility in Sweden between Nel, OVAKA, VOLVO, HITACHI and H2-GREENSTEEL to produce steel from renewable energies (06/2021)

- Nel and LINESIGHT announced that they collaborate on the delivery of a brand new hydrogen fuel station for 20 hydrogen buses for Transport for London. One of the key objectives of the Mayor of London’s Transport Strategy is the decarbonisation of London’s bus network under which all TfL’s buses will be electric or hydrogen fueled at the latest by 2037 (06/2021)

- Nel joins POSHYDON: This project aims to convert demineralized water made from seawater into hydrogen by electrolysis, the electricity is provided by offshore wind turbines (07/2021)

Sustainability is their key to success and their code of conduct points out the importance of business ethics. Their aim is to produce clean energy and increase the usability of renewable energies. Their CEO, Jon André Løkke, has been appointed as the new President of Hydrogen-Europe, taking over the reins from Valerie Bouillon-Delporte (06/2021).This is a company which whole concept is made for future generations. Production, storage, fuelling and vehicles! This might be the epitome of GreenStockMarket.


THE STOCK

Now take a look at the stock (NEL ASA, US-symbol: NLLSF. ISIN: NO0010081235, WKN: A0B733, ticker-symbol: D7G). Following the 2021 Hydrogen-Hype the company came from a bullish to a bearish share price which has more then halved by now. On one hand a lot of short term investors lost money but on the other hand the stock can now build ground and establish a stable chart for the future. Nevertheless there are big hedgefonds shorting over 100 million shares of Nel (about 7,82 % of all shares by now). 

https://shortnordic.com/detaljer_selskap.php?company=NEL&land=norway

If you know about shortselling I don't have to tell you that this is bad! Instead of investing in a future oriented company like Nel, the hedgefonds decided to bet on its downfall. By that they put the whole company in a downward spiral, deter new investors and slowly make it irrelevant in the future.


SO WHY INVEST AT ALL

If supporting a company which follows the own ideals and saving its existance is not enough there are further reasons on an international scale to invest in a company like Nel:

- The EU wants to increase hydrogen production about 40 times and wants to reduce production costs for green H2 about 80 % till 2030 (10/2020)

-  BLOOMBERG-NEF estimates the hydrogen-market till 2050 up to 700 billion $ (a quarter of the worldwide energy-market, 11/2020)

- US major bank CITIGROUP sees hydrogen stocks on the upswing, especially the introduction of new solar and wind projects as well as the countries that are increasingly relying on a hydrogen strategy (06/2021) 

- At a RELIANCE shareholders' meeting, Mukesh Ambani, head of India's largest listed company, got his shareholders in the mood for the green realignment of the group. The supply of India with environmentally friendly, i.e. green hydrogen and the construction of one of the ""largest integrated renewable energy plants in the world"" are at the center of his considerations (06/2021)

- The EU's FitFor55-package gives a significant boost to the development of the European hydrogen industry through a 50% target on the share of renewable hydrogen consumption in industry, concrete and ambitious targets for hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives in the Fuel EU maritime proposal and more hydrogen refuelling stations.

pessimism is not realism,boring_civilian,39,p4tfp4,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/p4tfp4/pessimism_is_not_realism/,12,"Alright, I have to blow off some steam: I hate all this negativity. Whenever I discuss the environment with friends, all I hear is ""it's too late"" or ""we can't do anything"". It's the same everywhere.

Whenever something bad happes (for example: wildfires spread) people say ""That proves it! We can all give up, the world is lost!""

But whenever something good happens (for example: Ecosia plants a hundred million trees) people say ""that doesn't change anything, they can't counteract all the deforestation"". And yes, Ecosia hasn't saved the world yet, but it's a start!

Why are we so obsessed with badmouthing good deeds? It's almost like we WANT to see the world burn.

One of the most idiotic arguments is ""Humans are just too greedy or stupid or evil to make the world a better place"". Oh, really? Ask 100 random people if they think deforestation is good. Not one of them will say yes. Not even right wing populists or oil company CEOs get out of the bed in the morning and think ""today I will ruin the planet a bit more"". We don't have to change humans. We all have good intentions. But we are masters at lying to ourselves. The oil CEO doesn't think they're evil. They think by pumping oil they're protecting jobs. The populist doesn't think they're evil. They think by obstructing green energy they're protecting society from the ""evil leftists"".

It's the same with every crysis, of course. We lull ourselves into inaction with sentences like ""it's too late"". Some people say ""we can't make the world more equitable"" while others fight for a universal basic income. Some say ""we can't save the climate"" while others fight for climate justice.

Does it give people a feeling of superiority being cynics? Has it become cool to be a pessimist? Why do hopeless people even keep talking about the climate? When did we start to confuse pessimism with realism?

&#x200B;

If you are cynical and need a bit of hope, I highly recommend these books. They helped me a lot:

I think I will read your books.', 'Never give up!!! And keep preaching, and having hope!', ""Thank you for saying this.  It is greatly affecting my mental health to have people constantly posting articles about climate change and then being so pessimistic.  It's almost like the only ones sharing are the cynics."", 'I know things can be really bad right now, but that doesn’t mean we should give up. I tend to be a bit pessimistic when it comes to these things but it only drives me more. I think this mindset that it doesn’t make a dent should stop, a microscopic dent is better than no dent at all. Like sure, refraining a plastic straw doesn’t feel like much, but that straw could’ve been the final straw that breaks everything (sounds a bit over dramatic but we can’t tell the future so, who knows) (also, pun not intended)', 'If you talk about any social responsibility people talk like this - it\'s defensiveness.\n\n\nI have a friend that\'s been vegan for years and no one at his work knew until recently because he had to order a dinner.

I can\'t imagine someone using the same logic with slaves, and yet, I bet they did. ""Everyone does it"" seems to be a reason to live unethically. But again, it\'s all defensiveness.', 'Recommended reading I found super helpful - Rebecca Solnit, Hope in the Dark\n\n“Hope locates itself in the premises that we don’t know what will happen and that in the spaciousness of uncertainty is room to act. When you recognize uncertainty, you recognize that you may be able to influence the outcomes–you alone or you in concert with a few dozen or several million others. Hope is an embrace of the unknown and knowable, a alternative to the certainty of both optimists and pessimists. Optimists think it will all be fine without our involvement; pessimists take the opposite position; both excuse themselves from acting. It’s the belief that what we do matters even though how and when it may matter, who and what is may impact, are not things we can know beforehand. We may not, in fact, know them afterward either, but they matter all the same, and history is full of people whose influence was most powerful after they were gone.”  \n― Rebecca Solnit, Hope in the Dark\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis pessimism is also driving me mad. That is why I just started a subreddit for discussing climate change activism without it - https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingClimateHope', ""The culture of nihilism is a consequence of individualistic philosophy's preconceptions of some necessity for absolute external authority (which is a contradiction in terms) to justify past behaviour , which is a tragic distortion of mythos to the joy of class-power. You can always spread happiness, it precludes rationality. That's why Reason isn't enough to understand the world ( or death ) ."", 'Thank You, i completely agree. It is very common that people are critical about the wrong things. Our entire society has a kind of auto immune disease in many ways. One of these is that people learn to be skeptical in their attitude, but are not decerning enough to choose correctly what to be critical about. We are supposed to be critical of that which is inauthentic, and immitation, but instead people are critical of that which is genuinely good and original.\n\nI am trying to Save the Earth, by creating an event where leaders meet in nature with traveling artists, and environmental activists. However so far i have been repeatedly dismissed. My posts are downvoted, my emails are marked as spam, etc.\n\nIt is because of this misplaced criticism towards the genuine visionaries and prophets that our society is crumbling. We only listen to those with superficial appearence of wisdom and generosity,  those who live authentical and follow their ethical compass are poor, unsupported, unknown. \n\nIf anyone wants to be a part of the movement im trying to create, you can find on the most recent post I made Here on fridays for future page', 'It\'s not off though, newest reports have shown that even if we pulled our collective shit together tonight we\'ll still cross thresholds that will hurt us immensely.

Discussion about strategy: negotiation additionally to protest? (German situation) - I need some opinions from you! And maybe some help.,AdviceSea8140,15,otsl87,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/otsl87/discussion_about_strategy_negotiation/,1,"This will be a text wall. Sorry for that in advance. I hope, you still read this, since it seems important to me.
The discussion is from my point of view in Germany and might not be actual (or not yet actual) for other countries.

**Introduction**

Let me start with, what I do. I work in the finance industry and I have a very good view on what companies do 
regarding environmental protection right now.
The situation is, that everyone thinks about environmental protection. Even institutional investors are looking for 
environmental friendly investment options. This is a good thing, because if you give money to good instead of bad 
companies than this forces the bad companies to change. Unfortunatly, this is not enough. Change is slow and it is 
in fact not about good or bad. It is about different interests. Even the most environmental-aware Manager (yes, 
they exist!) get's paid by his company to make money - not to safe the world.

The conclusion is: awareness is there - at least much more than we think.

**The Problem**

To make people or companies change we need to force them to change. Not in a ""change or I place a bomb under your car""-way but in a appropriate way. That means the environmental oriented people need to negotiate their interests against the 
interestes of the companies. The leverage of groups like FFF is publicity and many, many people. This can surly be 
utilized in negotiations. Unfortunatly this is not how environmental groups think. They might think doing a protest and 
to raise awareness is the thing to do. But in fact, we already have that. There is need for a change in strategy or at least 
for an additional startegy.

**My proposal**

I propose we should start thinking, how we can negotiate with big companies. 

**My idea to help**

I wrote a (German) book on negotiation for young people from age 12 and up in a very understandable way. It is in fact a fantasy novel, which utilizes negotiation instead of magical wepaons to sort things out with the enemy. Yes, I know. We all love reading stories about kids with magical abilities (""Harry, can you save us?"") or super heroes (""Superman, help me. The bad people rob me!""). 

But we all know: We don't have magical swords. 
And if we had them - how to use them? Just kill all bad people? No, that is no solution at all. You just get school stabbings with your magical  weapons.

I even contacted several environmental groups (from FFF to WWF), if they want a any kind of cooperation. I also offered free 
information pages at the end of the book about their groups - without any payment. None of them answered. I Just fear 
that I worte this book in vain.

**Discussion**

I would like to know, what you think about this whole situation. Is awareness enough to make people change?",1627542844.0,15,0,,"['[deleted]', 'Mia Raloris. You will find it in a couples days in book shops. More Infos at website Https://miaraloris.de']"

How can we further raise awareness for climate solutions?!,RegretFreeNoMore,19,ohyghf,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/ohyghf/how_can_we_further_raise_awareness_for_climate/,6,"We've spent the last 2 years developing a game of hope and action for the climate, aptly titled ""[Solutions](https://solutionsthegame.com)"" 

We have spent thousands of hours during the game’s development to build the game’s foundation on cutting-edge climate research. For example, the core solutions in the game are inspired by the ground-breaking work of Paul Hawken, the creator of Project Drawdown and One Generation. Other research, such as the feedback loop cards and the starting points for global temperature, is based on NASA, the IPCC, UNFCCC, NOAA, Yale, Stanford, the World Resources Institute, the World Economic Forum, the AMPERE Database, and more. 

We worked on the game to enable you to have fun while having meaningful discussions about climate change.  It's a collaborative board game: faced by the threat of rising temperatures, you and your team must work together to deploy unique and surprising climate solutions to avoid climate catastrophe!  

I’m a big fan of Fridays For Future, can anyone suggest how we can raise awareness for these solutions (game aside) if we don’t get acting on these solutions soon, we will enter some seriously messed up Feedback Loops…",1625980717.0,19,0,,"['This looks really sweet. But can you please explain why you still need a kickstarter? The game seems to be already done?\n\nTo which extent does the game cover reducing emissions by shutting down certain industries and changes to lifestyles?', 'stop asking nicely.', 'Hey /u/natyio, the Kickstarter is to fund the production run (& getting the game out there to distributors), we worked with the various climate researchers from organizations like Project Drawdown for the last 18 months putting together all the data, research, prototyping and refining the game completely on a volunteer basis.\n\nIn terms of impact, our larger goal was to utilize our QR code to provide project/action templates for people to get involved at an individual, community or organization basis (based on the solutions they came across while playing).\n\nWhat was surprising during our playtest (sent the game to various groups including schools) we realized what we hypothesized with turning the game into action started to happen; a loca news station caught onto one of the initiatives that was started after a single classroom played the game [(here’s what we saw)](https://solutionsthegame.com/take-action/)\n\nPart of our Kickstarter is to raise funds to further raise awareness, as we’ve now started to work with political organizations in the Canada (GreenPAC) & UK (People’s Plan) to use the game to educate politicians and their constituents on the local level; we also are trying to find more corporate partnerships to use the game as a ‘team building’ exercise as it employs communication skills (whilst potentially triggering employees to think about not just individual actions but at the corporate GHG scope I and II level.', ""Thanks for the extensive answer to the first question! I'll keep an eye on the kickstarter. Do you have a few more words for my second question?"", 'A lot of the solutions tap into what you said, shifts in industries (from agricultural practices, means of energy generation, etc.) as well as lifestyle changes.  The work of the Project Drawdown researchers attempted to quantify impact not just based on the CO2E of each solution, but also around adoption & regional/local feasibilities. \n\nSo even though we would love to see massive wide scale industry changes, it’s a lot more feasible in some geographies than others, but lifestyle changes are the few impactful things that can happen through awareness & education - it can also have massive adoption rates and higher feasibility of penetration (across geographies across the world). \n\nI wouldn’t want to get into the individual models we reviewed and adapted but to summarize the real world action we’ve seen come from those who played the game, started with lifestyle changes but it rippled into their broader communities and for some led to changes in the workplace.\n\nMy own personal belief is that at the end it needs to start at the individual. We might paint corporates as this ‘non-human’ entity, but at the end it’s made of individual people that can be influenced through education and their peers. (As well as regulatory / policy but that’s a much longer game and I don’t personally think we have time to hope for that… I’d prefer to see that collective action today)', 'Also since you brought up stopping industry, when we were debating how to offset our carbon footprint for the game we met with the team at [Cooler](https://www.cooler.dev/).\n\nWe love what they do, so we also partnered with them to neutralize our emissions vs offset, basically what they do at a simplistic level is they literally shut down coal companies by buying up the limited number of ‘polluting permits’ in certain jurisdictions that are subject to these laws. Basically it limits how often these polluting plants can operate and especially when all the credits are ‘locked up’, they literally have to shut down! The longer they are shut down; the less profitable the plant is compared to alternative energy sources, so now it makes economic sense for even those who operate these plants to have to transition, not because it’s the right thing to do, but because they literally have an asset that is costing them money without being able to operate.\n\nI don’t think my explanation does their work justice, I suggest reading more on it yourself if you are interested.\n\nAs they summarize:\n\n“Cooler neutralizes the impact of shopping by buying permits away from polluters in tightly-regulated pollution markets. This method of eliminating your purchase’s footprint is NOT a carbon offset. Offsets are typically used by polluters to continue business as usual.\n\nCooler certifiably eliminates greenhouse gases equivalent to the footprint of your purchases by buying pollution permits away from industrial polluters. \n\nCarbon emissions (and other pollutants that go along with them) are stopped at the source and the permit fees are further invested in conservation and clean energy projects that have generated thousands of jobs.”\n\nCan read more [here](https://www.cooler.dev/neutralization)']"

Both cases reveal how financial conflicts of interest can skew biomedical research. Such conflicts also occur in electric-utility-related research.

Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using “overnight” costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes. If these trimmed costs are included, nuclear-generated electricity can be shown roughly 6 times more expensive than most studies claim. After answering four objections, the paper concludes that, although there may be reasons to use reactors to address climate change, economics does not appear to be one of them.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-009-9181-y)\n\nIt is the same PR technique that the tobacco industry used when fighting the fact that smoking causes cancer.\n\n> [The industry campaign worked to create a scientific controversy through a program that depended on the creation of industry–academic conflicts of interest.

Because its a closed loop system, you actually need 95%+ less water, which makes hydroponic much more accessible in arid regions with limited water supply. When it comes to jobs hydroponics is much more automated and mechanized and requires a much higher fraction of skilled labour. And so switching over hyrdoponics and alike will cause a large fraction of the world population to be unemployable with their current skillset. I however is in favour of technological unemployment and think that it\'s unavoidable and that the onus is on our socioeconomic system to adapt to ensure that people can live comfortable life.\n\n> culturebased foods, the willingness of people to adapt to a smaller variety of vegetables and so on.\n\nThere\'s a lot of plants that can be grown hydro-/aeroponically. Potato, wheat, rice, and cassava has been grown this way successfully. And sure, there might be a handful of small volume vegetables etc that has to be grown in soil, I\'m fine with that if we can cut out the vast majority of agricultural products.\n\n> But your proposed idea is indeed new to me and I am very interested, do you have some links to get more info?\n\nThere\'s a lot of science on it, you can start reading the wikipedia articles on it for example. The technology has been commercially applied for over a decade at this point.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHpNu4_6uc0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ww2TP_tU7o']"

Electric cars are key for a sustainable future in my opinion. They are paving the way for a circular battery economy. This is the enabler for a sustainable energy future. Without cheap batteries that can be recycled by almost 100% no sustainable path for the future is possible. Just my 2 cents.', 'This depends on your target: do you want to stabilize climate and the planetary ecosystem or do you want simply to slow down the path to a hothouse Earth? For the latter, electric cars are great. For the former, electric cars might lead to a new lock-in situation with all the downsides of it. In particular, the actually needed societal changes to stabilize Earth are probably not achievable with an electric car based society (see article above).\nINDIVIDUAL motorized vehicles (aka cars) are responsible for (and not only): CO2 emissions (would be reduced by electric cars, but electricity needs to be generated), fine particules ppm2.5 (from tires and breaks), paved roads and parkings -> water flow disturbance, light pollution, noise pollution, natural animal migration disturbances, no place for people in cities, hazard for bicycles and pedestrians, cars encourage spread out cities -> destruction of land, etc...', ""Happy cake day. While I agree with you, that cars aren't really needed in cities, they are in the countryside. There are many villages where mass transit would be equally ore more detrimental, cause it would be unused most of the time, while requiring a similar amount of infrastructure. I can't by anything but basic food any hygiene products (30min walk to the next larger village) without a car. Because the bus route here was used so little, they cut most busses to the extent, that it isn't suitable for participation in modern society to rely on busses alone. The next train station is as far away as the next city, so an electric car, charged with renewable energy, and carpooling are the only options I see in the near future."", 'I absolutely agree with all of your points. I dont like cars, too. Try to avoid using mine as much as possible.\nCars will go away one day I strongly believe that. Car sharing is just the beginning and soon enough nobody needs to own a car anymore. And nobody will. The trick is to use the power of capitalism with a parameter set that applies to our targets. Change the system is what I am thinking about. The targets and parameters must be changed from „eternal growth“ to „renewable“ and cars will go away very soon.', 'Thanks for the cake day wishes, that made me smile more than I thought it would :D \n\nOf course in the current set of the infracstructure, it would be almost impossible to remove the car. But, 60 years, most people, also in the country side, did not have car. There has been a transformation from non-car based society to car-based society. This transformation included the building of suburbs, the idea that companies can build their factories where it is cheap because people have cars, the idea that few giant shops can be built instead of having a network of small shops etc... We could not change this from today to tomorrow. But we MUST aim for it in the next 30-50 years. One can also start smaller: all cities should be car free, then we can think of the countryside. And one should start with personal car free (which means one can still rent a car for the 2-3 times a year one needs it for logistic reasons).', 'I hope you are right!']"

Now that we know what must be done, and why it must be done, we can finally focus on how we can start to do it. This society is contingent upon a few axioms:

1. The Axiom of Choice/Free Association. If someone decides to join this society it’s completely a free choice of theirs.

This axiom means that we have to locate this society in a place that has little to no current population. This also means that people born in this society must retain the citizenship of the parents and that there will be no native citizens of the society.

2. The Axiom of explicitness. There are no agreements that have not been made explicitly clear.

This axiom means that any social contracts are actual contracts signed by all whom they pertain to.

3. The Axiom of Self-Reliance. All basic necessities for the whole population must be provided by production in the society

Were this not to be the case then foreign powers would hold the real power.

These axioms when they interact limit the scope of possibilities, to several lightly to uninhabited locations (because of axiom 1). That are either geothermal active or, near a geothermal hotspot(because of axiom 3 applied to energy). When mapping all the remaining locations out this is what it looks like with somewhat loose criteria.

&#x200B;

After narrowing down to the possible locations we can start to in detail plan out a human and environmental centered economy.

We have the most information on what a current typical first-world human needs so let’s start there.

Obviously people food, water shelter, and clothing

Modern construction is reliant on three core materials those being, wood, concrete, and steel.

&#x200B;

When we get into the specifics of how these materials are made we see that steel and concrete are both composite materials meaning they’re made not grown or harvested.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nxahhfwntye61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7acad97d8e9bd959fec627aee7656504af001f4

The modern processes for making these materials make up at least 10.2% of global emissions([https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector)). Yet there are known materials that perform better and are made of industrial waste products. One such material being GGBFS(ground granulated blast furnace slag) a steel industry by-product, or fly ash another blast furnace waste product. After doing lots of research you can then rework construction to take advantage of this fact and the fact that when you use prefabrication as the only means of production you can automate and control the whole process.

Housing

Zooming out of construction we can now start to talk about housing. The home is the center of most human activity. By focusing our design on making the individual homes of a society as self-sufficient as possible, we can ensure that residents will be fine as well. However, not everyone desire’s the same living conditions as others. Some people prefer to live more communally and some people prefer to live more solitarily. To account for this several different living styles of living should be provided. Below are my proposed styles.

Rural: High Concentration

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o5w52p9qtye61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=4636db7e7dac8f0b8e82192b81930f3cf8f0f75a

Rural high concentration living is a lavish communal living style in which 20–30 people all live in one big mansion. This living-style is based on modern housing cooperatives. Each house would have its own distinct culture, sewage system, and both rooftop garden, and basement marine garden. They’d also be situated each in a permacultural food forest which gradually transitions to a traditional forest.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/redjphmrtye61.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=beba4643323c1addbcf85e06e01c714c1c1813ae

Rural: Low Concentration

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x9bv5cjttye61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5d8352a29526a2bda50565b9fb1c832ad48861

Rural low concentration is a living style where the community is spread between separate houses that are spaced out quite a bit. Each house is a part of a loose community with neighbors being there but not visible. Think rural Kansas or Michigan. Each house is still surrounded first by a food forest and then that transitions to a natural forest.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4qcydpputye61.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=21566194b3054a0902b121cf7c84aa5ff46ba257

Urban: Low Concentration

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uvqqhp2wtye61.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=599fcc860182ea4e5215f2a60109933ad9dd492e

Urban low concentration or suburban is a living style where many small groups of people come together to form a decent-sized community with greater density than that of a rural community.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jotq9l5xtye61.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fe8718bf19b6643be412bf23e2d35581b8f1cfa

Urban: High Concentration

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0ymuz7ytye61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aba68dec58c5355fd7430b47bf3cc98314a061f

Urban high concentration is a living style where many communities exist is a small space sometimes even right on top of each other. This type of living style is comprised of single-person apartments, all the way to huge urban co-ops. It’s characterized by its diversity, plurality, and busyness.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elb0d49ztye61.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7170c76337b83c4b9d279973c0346a4b156001f6

Using these housing models as a substitute for individuals we can then design our systems with each of these different types of housing in mind. Ensuring that every community has all of the things required for a modern human.

The Way Out Of This Mess: What is The Solution,llcoolj92301,18,l8o0fd,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/l8o0fd/the_way_out_of_this_mess_what_is_the_solution/,3,"medium link: [https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess/chapter-1-what-is-the-solution-1ad34e7bda36](https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess/chapter-1-what-is-the-solution-1ad34e7bda36)

The solution is the decommodification of everything through sustainability, automation, and essentialism. Easy right? In more concrete terms, the solution is to strengthen the relationship between production, consumption, and sustainability. The solution is to design society in such a way that things are not just produced, for-profit; but actually for the benefit of humanity as a whole. This means abandoning the concepts of money, unending growth, and thoughtless consumption. And instead of building a society based around community, intention, and sustainability. To do this it is not possible to work within the current bounds of liberal democracy. It is also not advisable to try and seek a violent nonconsensual revolution.

Let’s go over what I just postulated in detail. Decommodification is the process of taking things that were once traded as commodities (i.e. for our purposes branded products in a capitalist market) and turning them into something else. A good example of what this looks like is the free u-pick fields in the Midwestern United States. These are fields of usually blueberries that have been left to grow and now are a community resource that you can harvest from freely. Another example from before capitalism took hold were the British commons before the enclosure movement. These resources weren’t traded weren’t branded they were just resources that existed. Making resources the property of all is not the only way to decommodify resources. For soldiers in the American military, MRE and other government equipment are not commodified.

Sustainability can be hard and nebulous, to define. It’s often much easier to start off with what not sustainable; and then try and postulate what a world without those things might look like. Therefore a world with no unsustainable elements = a more sustainable world. Things that are unsustainable usually produce nothing of usable value to either nature or humans after they have been used. Due to the nature of thermodynamics, everything will eventually end up in this state. But how long it takes to reach that state give a good metric by which we can measure the sustainability of a given object (how long until everything associated with it is unusable), or a system (what sustainable vs unsustainable distribution does it produce), or a society (how do many of the systems which make up a society are sustainable). By this definition, there are very few things that are unsustainable but there are plenty of things that aren’t that sustainable. For example, many plastics are considered unsustainable because once they are used they can’t be recycled into new high-value items. But they can be used for all sorts of things they are just of lower value (building material, decoration, synthetic thread, etc). So we see that certain plastics can be rated on how after each use how much value does it lose after each use (both to humans, and to the environment). And how other plastics such as bioplastics, for example, are very sustainable because after reuse they maintain a larger percentage of their value and actually gain value to the environment. Applied to products this means practices like planned obsolescence are unsustainable because they are built upon the product losing value over its lifecycle. Applied to systems this means that inflation is usually unsustainable as it makes the store of value such as the dollar lose value overtime with no gain in its worth to the environment.

Automation is not really that hard to pin down it is the completion of labor (the process of adding or transmuting value) being done by a non-human autonomous(self-managing) agent. That means tool use is not necessarily automation having a better axe does not make one’s job more automated. Usually, this takes place when machinery’s lifetime cost is less than that of a human laborer’s. This can only happen however is the machinery’s initial cost can be paid. Integrated automated systems lead to an astonishing network effect of rapid and efficient just in time manufacturing.

Essentialism is an offshoot of the minimalist movement, with minimalism being a response to hyper-consumerism. The goal of both minimalism and essentialism is to consume less. Essentialism goes about this by practicing “the disciplined pursuit of less”. What I am advocating for is not the mainstream version of either minimalism or essentialism. What I’m advocating for is what I’d like to call “the disciplined pursuit of nonsuperfluous self”. Which combines the tenants of Essentialism, Non-Alienated labor, and Zen Buddhism. The idea is to have an intimate relationship with the things you come to possess by making sure you only possess things that you truly care about. What this looks like is when let’s say you need new jeans you either find an artisan that knows how to make jeans and make an arrangement by which you receive jeans you love and they are fairly compensated, or you learn the craft of making jeans or realizing that the particular type of jean does not matter to you go and get a generic utilitarian, comfy pair.

Putting all these concepts together results in something magical. Completely automating the supply chains of things allows for those things to become decommodified without having to endure the “tragedy of the commons”. Through this, you can then treat those automated decommodified supply chains like you would a 3D printer meaning that for essentialist consumption it allows you to customize every step of the manufacturing process allowing consumers to have more say in the products they consume, ultimately leading to less waste, and more self-identification with the product. This whole system can be engineered from a systems design approach from the beginning with a mathematical definition of sustainability in it from the start allowing for it to rated on sustainability.

As long as these things can be produced sustainably after the startup costs are recuperated the things produced by these supply chains need not be bought or sold. The end result of this means that there is such a way in which you could set up a society like ancient Athens where for the citizens the basic necessities of life can be guaranteed without cost to anyone. This society is the solution, a society where production, consumption, and sustainability are inseparably intertwined. This society where things are produced for the benefit of each and every member of the society. This society in which money is a construct of the past, where consumption is not the rule of the day.",1612020658.0,18,0,,"['Hey there :)  \nThanks for sharing this, many of your ideas do resonate with me. I have a couple of questions and comments though. \n\n1. You talk about ""designing society differently"". How do you imagine that process? Who designs a society? And how is a design implemented? What I\'m trying to get at is: where is the interface between the idea space and physical reality? How does change happen?\n2. What you talk about with british commons and free to pick fields is called a common-pool ressource. It is characterized by a finite flow of benefits - meaning, if I go pick blueberries, those blueberries aren\'t available to anyoneelse - and in principal free access to the ressource for basically anyone. This characterization of a ressource is where the tragedy of the commons has been postulated by Hardin in the 60s. The question you should ask yourself is: How can a common-pool ressource be governed without a state intervening and without regulation through privatization and market forces - both of which got us into this mess. You might want to check out Elenor Ostroms work on self-organization in this context. (This might give you some answers to the questions I asked under point 1.\n3. I like your approach to sustainability. Asking what does create value for humans and the environment probably is a very fertile pointer. The next question that arises, is how do we assign value to anything? The societal dynamics by which value is assigned are -beside some other things - at the core of this mess too. Another, bit more dettached and systemic way of defining sustainability is: A system is sustainable when it does not externalize harm to it\'s environment, that it depends upon. Your definition leans even a bit further toward regeneration: how can we restore value instead of just not externalizing harm. Most unsustainable practices are characterized by the same patterns: extraction and accumulation (pollution) when keeping this in mind it is very easy to identify if a practice is sustainable or not. You just have to ask: does this extract from a ressource faster than it regenerates? And are there any side products that accumulate somewhere in the environment? This goes beyond the natural sciences. The pollution of the information economy can be viewed through the same lense and through this lense looks like an equally if not more problematic issue than CO2 emissions. You might want to check out Daniel Schmachtenbergers work on generator functions of existential threat and on the war on sensemaking (mostly podcasts on future thinkers and rebel wisdom).   \nQuick sidenote on plastics: if a plastic is sustainable or not depends entirely on the application you are using it for. If you want an artifact to be durable and usable for a long time plastics can be more sustainable than organic materials, because the energy cost in making them can be lower over their life cycle (and if they are recycelable). If the application is single use like a straw or packeging, plastics are super unsustainable.\n4. The value that automation can add to the world depends entirely on the economic and societal context that it is embedded in. If your entire livelihood depends on manual manufacturing, automation is the worst that can happen to you. If however the economic system is geared towards omni-win scenarios, where there a no loosers, automation is the sickest thing, because then you suddenly have half the day to do fun stuff. On that note I encourage you to think about the ways that competition hinders growth and human flourishing - opposite to the common argument for capitalism, that without competition we wouldn\'t get anywhere. When a company is in competition with another one, it is in both their interest to withhold information and/or manipulate a potential customer group into believing that their product is better (this loops back to the pollution of the information ecology). When in this mindset, the best possible outcoe with the combined knowledge and skills of all the people in both companies suddenly becomes counter their interest. What may have started with the search for the solution to a real problem turns into needing to win over another group that started out with the same intention of solving a problem. This reaches from the individual level through the interpersonal all the way to the organizational and nation state level.\n5. On the note of how goods can be decomodified I would recommend you check out the P2P foundations work on commons-based peer production. A commons is ressource that is in theory open to use by anyone, but the access and use is regulated by a group of people, that give themselves a set of rules about what the ressource can be used for and at what rate. Peer production refers to a loose and open network, that anyone can join and that is producing something from the collevtively governed commons. A practical example would be a community supported agriculture, where the land and all the machines are owned by a non-profit, the membership fees are on a sliding scale, where each member can pay however much they can afford and decissions on what crops are grown and what tools and machines should be invested in are made collectively. Also worth mentioning Dmitry Kleiners idea of a venture commune here.   \n\n\nI guess the most important thing to keep in mind when thinking about all of this is: how do we get there? What are actionable steps that we can take right now, that take us closer in that direction. Sorry for not providing links to all the ressources I mentioned, but google is your friend here ;)   \n\n\nOne final note: I\'m not meaning to lecture you. Everything I said is up for discussion if you like. I just recognized a lot of the puzzle pieces that make up a majority of my thinking these days and thought I\'d offer my view and some of the ressources that enabled me to see the world like that.

How do you imagine that process? \n\nI have my own way in which I\'m going to try and go about it but I don\'t think that there is one right way to change society, however, I do believe that get elected won\'t work. My preferred method is based on co-ops\n\n>Who designs a society?\n\nIt depends on how the society manifests, In my model I would have it be a work of conscious co-creation, i.e. everyone working towards a clearly defined goal. \n\n> And how is a design implemented? \n\nThis is the issue of governance I have chosen to strictly steer clear of putting forwards a governance model, I\'m trying to put forward mostly a resource production and distribution model that has step by step instructions for implementation. When I say step by step implementation I referring to things like acquire 1 acre of land, get it surveyed, look up the climate zones, etc.  Not how to acquire the land, or how to survey it, or govern the immigration policy, etc. \n\n>What I\'m trying to get at is: where is the interface between the idea space and physical reality? How does change happen?\n\nChange happens by gathering the things necessary to make it happen. I am laying out what resources are needed in detail not how to acquire them. I do plan on acquiring them but for now, I think it\'s necessary to layout what they are.\n\n>What you talk about with british commons and free to pick fields is called a common-pool ressource. It is characterized by a finite flow of benefits - meaning, if I go pick blueberries, those blueberries aren\'t available to anyoneelse - and in principal free access to the ressource for basically anyone. \n\nYou\'re mostly correct you\'re working off a traditional capitalist model. The necessary change is that there isn\'t a finite flow of benefits. When you talk about you pick, these are unmanaged fields that would either die off, or grow like weeds (depending on the conditions) if people didn\'t care about them. The opening up of access causes people who use it to maintain its existence at the bare minimum.\n\n>This characterization of a ressource is where the tragedy of the commons has been postulated by Hardin in the 60s.\n\nThe [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) actually goes back to an English economist from 1833. It was conceived to help provide academic justification for the [Enclosure Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclosure_Acts). It\'s not necessarily true and has [a lot of critics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01357919).\n\n> The question you should ask yourself is: How can a common-pool ressource be governed without a state intervening and without regulation through privatization and market forces - both of which got us into this mess. \n\nMy personal solution is to shorten the feedback loop. For example in the next post, I outline how housing might work. In my model, most people live inside [a food forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GJFL0MD9fc). This means that a large percentage of their calories is self harvested the amount of work it would take to fuck up their food forest is more than amount of people who live in the food forest.\n\n>You might want to check out Elenor Ostroms work on self-organization in this context.

Asking what does create value for humans and the environment probably is a very fertile pointer. The next question that arises, is how do we assign value to anything? \n\nThis to me is relatively easy for nature is it used in the ecosystem, i.e. biodegradable, fertilizer, or food. The relative value is then dictated by how useful (rarity in the ecosystem, and how many things can use it in other words demand)\n\n>The societal dynamics by which value is assigned are -beside some other things - at the core of this mess too.

The Way Out Of This Mess,llcoolj92301,24,l785el,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/l785el/the_way_out_of_this_mess/,3,"I'm writing a manifesto that details a way to step by step make a more sustainable post-scarcity world the Prologue focuses on how fucked we are:

People….. we’re fucked. I mean like reeeaaaally fucked. I’m writing this at the tail end of 2020, we are in the midst of a global pandemic. Due to which many people have restricted their lives, leading to a 7% drop in carbon emissions ⁽¹⁾. In spite of all this, 2020 is shaping up to be, if not the top, at least in the top 3 warmest years on record⁽²⁾. Climate change isn’t coming, it’s here.

It’s not just the climate though. Income inequality is the highest it’s been in 50 years⁽³⁾. Political Polarization is at levels not seen since the last civil war. Which is keeping us from foreseeing the upcoming Thucydides Trap, and employment crisis due to automation. Human civilization is rushing headlong into a cyberpunk dystopia.

If we don’t do something and fast then we can kiss this “Long Peace” goodbye. Now I’m not the only one to think this, even mainstream news outlets have caught on that the jig is coming to an end. Plenty of people are looking to solve our current problems through ideological means. The revitalized American left seems mainly to think that through electoralism they can shift American policy enough to avoid the impending climate catastrophe. To put that in perspective the IPCC says that to mitigate the worst effect of climate change on human society, we should limit warming to 1.5℃ above preindustrial levels⁽⁴⁾. That is not to avoid climate change that’s just to mitigate the worst effects. 2016 was 1.1℃ above preindustrial levels⁽⁵⁾. The WMO says that we will hit 1.5℃ above preindustrial levels by 2024⁽⁶⁾. To be honest given the current geopolitical situation we can kiss our nice stable climate goodbye. That doesn’t mean that there’s no hope, it just means we have to switch the current paradigm of thinking around climate change.

The current idea is that we will get all the nations on earth, to drastically reduce their CO₂ emissions and keep them down. Not only does this require levels of global cooperation never before seen, but it also disproportionately benefits rich countries who have the money to transition to cleaner fuels; that’s just for the climate issue. Instead of relying on a moonshot that the world is consistently making more and more infeasible, I propose a different approach. Instead of waiting for governments to change, I propose we change. Instead of hoping that the climate doesn’t change, I propose we change so that it doesn’t matter. If we’re are not only going to survive but thrive in the next 50 years, then we need to, with intention, plan out a route from our current catastrophe through sustainability the lands us in a promising future.

We can create a better society, we have to create a better society. One that can stand up to the problems of climate change, and wealth inequality, and finally secure a basic livelihood for all. To do this we need to realize that there are two major fronts that demand attention and intention. That being the technical issues of how to build a climate change-resistant, sustainable society; and the epistemological how to organize that society sustainable, equitably, and such that it doesn’t collapse. Now this book is strictly meant to deal with the technological side of this issue. Though if you subscribe to certain sociological theories then the technological mode of production implies a certain sociological structure.

This book is more of an introduction to the types of solutions we could apply to the problem of work and non-sustainable production. I have limited my scope to make the task manageable however, this means that not everyone can partake in the society that I am laying out. I don’t take this to mean that there is not a sustainable solution for all, it just means that I cannot as an individual find it. I propose that the approach I take in this book can be applied by others to their own circumstances to produce similar results.

I'll make it easy for you.\n\nHere are my main points:\n\nThe Green New Deal, which I actually read, would abolish nuclear energy, make the US dependent on windmills, which we now know can freeze, causing massive outages in the worst part of the year, and they are also non-recyclable, which means they are just gonna pile up in Wyoming.\n\nAfter the US left the Paris Climate Accords, it's emissions went down, but US politicians still claimed that the US should be in the Accords, even though the emissions went down. It makes no sense. The US did better when it was out of the Accords. It proves that it this a game that politicians will play to obtain political points by claiming to support limiting emissions because the US has proved to stand nothing to gain from being in the Accords, but they still support it.\n\nAfter WW2, the US and actually global emissions skyrocketed because of a technological boom. And the global temperature remained unaffected. This proves that Climate Change is not caused by human emissions because, if it was, then the global temperature should have gone up a significant amount in the 40s. *But it didn't*\n\nJust try to prove me wrong on even one of these points. If you can't, then your argument for climate change being caused by humans is flawed, because it has to account for these facts or else it isn't grounded in reality."", 'And it’s ironic because you are asking someone to prove that you are a conspiracy theorist when proof is something that you seem to ignore.', 'All arguments are won on the Internet with “your pathetic” cheers', ""No, they're won with a well structured argument.

I mean, even one of yall gave me a death threat for saying that stuff. Just prove me wrong instead of thinking Im wrong"", 'Are you asking me to prove that anthropogenic climate change is real?', 'It’s been proven.', 'Anthropogenic. Yes. And you have somehow justify why the factors I declared fit into your proof.', 'I don’t think anything I could say would convince you. It’s a done deal bro. Climate change deniers are in the realm of the flat earthers now. You will continue to be ridiculed, but glhf. I learnt how the climate functions and the changes we are making in my earth science degree, if you don’t know these things i can’t teach it to you on Reddit comments.', ""Again, you're giving up. It's pathetic. You have no idea how to argue"", ""Okay. Let's go back to something I stated before. After the US left the Paris Climate Accords, its emissions went down. And yet like 60% of professional politicians claimed that the US needed to stay in the accords. There are two ways to view this information.\n\nMy way: this, combined with the evidence I stated previously, is proof that climate change is not caused by humans. Because if it was caused by people, this would mean it is a threat humans can neutralize. But if humans can neutralize it, why did so many politicians protest leaving the Accords? It worked out better in the end, emissions-wise. \n\nWhat I would assume is your way: Climate Change is caused by humans, but the politicians in congresses across the US don't actually care about it, and are only pedaling supporting it for votes.\n\nAlso, I am not a Climate Change denier. I literally just don't think it's caused by people. There's too many things that people who claim to be against Climate Change don't want to talk about. And scientists have literallt been proclaiming that the world is going to end from Climate Change for the past 40 years. And guess what? NOTHING HAPPENED. It's absolutely stupid.""]"
Global Climate Strike March 19th,SummiePy,55,kzdctw,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/kzdctw/global_climate_strike_march_19th/,4,"Hi, all! I just found this Reddit so this is my first post here... please excuses any mistakes I might have with my post!

Fridays for future recently published a date for their global climate strike: March 19th. For anyone that might not be familiar, Fridays for future is, in general, a youth climate strike that happens when students walk out of class on Fridays. I’ve seen other groups at their events too, like Extinction Rebellion. I wanted to help get the word out and possibly get some advice and volunteers for the strike I want to plan.

In the past I went to a great protest at the Michigan Capitol building and I wanted to recreate that. However, I don’t know how to plan a protest exactly. I also would love to find any other climate activists from Michigan, United States to keep in touch with. 

My idea: I’m thinking that we can expect people to show up at 1pm with the rally starting at 1:15pm or more towards 1:30pm. Speakers and activists (including Indigenous climate activists) would speak until 2:30. Then, we’d take a walk around the area for 15 or 20ish minutes and head back to the Capitol. At that time there’d be a performance. Afterwards, more speakers would go on the steps to finish off the day. During at least one of the speeches, an activist would ask for action from the audience (share the protest on your story online, go live for a minute or two, invite a friend to the next protest, etc.). Speakers would use chants and songs throughout the day. Protesters would have the chance to talk to activists after the protest (expect people from Extinction Rebellion, Sunrise Movement, and other organizations to be present).

Again, this protest is GLOBAL so please start brainstorming! Maybe you can make a protest in your area as well!

On the plus side, I can join in on a Saturday (but at 12 am here lol)', 'Suggestion: Rally at intersections of 220-foot or 60m elevations above mean sea level and main thoroughfares/hwys to not only protest, but show the world where shorelines will be upon melting of all ice in Greenland and Antarctica.

Concept for an app to encourage environmental sustainability in our local communities,buckster1014,1,jjagzl,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/jjagzl/concept_for_an_app_to_encourage_environmental/,0,"For a few years now I have been working on a project called Ecopin. It is a concept for a social media platform that will have a user-generated social map that will encourage users of the app to go out and strengthen their local community. On this map users can create pins from three different categories; events, hotspots and environmental threats. Events can include any type of event going on in a local community, hotspots are places like green local businesses, recycling centers, and social services and threats can include anything from small amounts of plastic pollution on the side of the road, to large threats like groundwater and air pollution sources.

Here are some resources for the project; [Kickstarter](http://kck.st/2IGUfaq) , [Landing page](https://ecopin.org/) and [interactive design prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d4c3249e-8164-48e8-4274-17fae90cd18e-a2f2/screen/a94a6981-1911-4297-84a5-491dcb08fbfb/?fullscreen)

The main goal of the app is to build strong communities by encouraging the creation and increased participation at local events, as well as encouraging users to support local business over big box stores. The reason why sustainability is the secondary goal is because I want the target audience of the app to be more than just environmentalists, I want it to also reach those who are on the fence, or simply haven't found a reason to care yet. How we reach those people through the app is for them to join for the social aspect of the app, but as they participate in the app they begin to notice the threats that loom in their local community, ones they never really noticed before and that can threaten them or their loved ones. One reason why so many are on the fence about environmental threats is because they lack the visualization that it will ever threaten them personally, but this map will show them that environmental threats exist close to home, and that they can make a difference to fix that. That being said, if we try and force it down their throats, it will only scare them away, that's why threat pins will be as subtle as any other pin on the map.

The third goal is to create a social platform that encourages civil discourse, will not exploit users for private information and do it's best to prevent trolls and fake accounts from making it on the platform.  Division exists so commonly on other social platforms in part because of the exploitation by the platforms themselves and the lack of moderation. It creates a culture of distrust and irritation, which we then vent on each other. Division is also a primary reason why the environment became a divisive topic. Most people care about the future, but in this divided world we live in it is too easy for someone to believe that everything will be okay and we don't need to do anything about the environment, because a greenwashed advertisement for an oil company said so.

In order to get Ecopin developed, I need the help of the green community. While I created the concept and design prototype for the app, I am only a graphic designer and do not have an ounce of programming knowledge. I was able to gather a few volunteer programmers to help begin the base code of the app, but we eventually hit a wall where they couldn't dedicate enough time to the project due to having full time jobs. Furthermore, I do not want Ecopin to be my project, I want it to be community-driven with input from anybody who wants to be involved.

I  wish to create a community around the development and eventual release of the project, but honestly I kind of suck at leadership and outreach and want to find people willing to help out there too. While a kickstarter may help me get the funds to recruit people with the technical skills needed to move the project forward, what I really feel the project needs is more people with a passion for the environment who want to see the three goals of the Ecopin be actualized in the final product. Feel free to message me if you have any interest in helping out in any way. Feel free to share as well to help spread the word about the project.

Thank you for taking the time to read about Ecopin!

Signs of Collapse 2020 Q3,Dave37,34,j3b5tf,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/j3b5tf/signs_of_collapse_2020_q3/,8,"Hi /r/FridaysForFuture! I have been working on an ongoing project for almost five years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). We can all see how the natural world that we’re depending on is degrading at an increasing pace while the warnings of the scientific community are ignored. I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable and free from fossil fuels, it's imperative that everyone fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

Urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. I hope this collection of catastrophes can serve as sharp ammunition in whatever project or strike you participate in.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.

This is why economical growth is vital to developing countries. \nHowever, the richer western societies have all they need to meet the basic human needs of their members. Other factors for well- being such as social recognition, sense, love, self-fulfilment etc. are not linked to further wealth or consumption. \nSo I think economy and economic science should be interpreted as tools which allow to satisfy basic human needs not only in a monetary (food, water, healthcare, education, mobility) but also in a social (social security, support of social needs i mentioned) way while respecting climate and resources.. \nThats why I think less consumption ->degrowth could not only help the environment but also our societies and well-being']"

Uni Project: Understanding Sustainability in Tech-Entrepreneurship,jnfinity,16,hx4cyf,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/hx4cyf/uni_project_understanding_sustainability_in/,3,"Hi Fridays for Future Redditors. 

I am a German student, studying Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Leadership, a programme at the Bremerhaven University of Applied Sciences where students start their own companies in form of team driven cooperatives to learn how to start, build and run a business with in the real world; but as you know this world is in great danger from an immanent thread of the climate crisis that we see done too little about. I want to find out how, as entrepreneurs, we can do our part and do stop the crisis. I don't think we can wait to do our what we can and instead need to act today in any way we can (because as entrepreneurs we have influence, I think. And we have to use it). 

But I think we also need more academic insight into how entrepreneurs can accomplish this. I have written some (so far unpublished) things about the subject, but as part of my work I am also looking for more insights into the perception of tech startups and sustainability in particular. And this brings me to what I hope you can help with: Please tell me, in your own opinion and perception, are tech entrepreneurs helping to make the world more sustainable or are they doing the opposite? When they openly commit to sustainability, are they, in your opinion, genuinely interested in making a difference or just engaging for PR? Do you perceive technological innovation to lead overall to more consumerism, more solutions to sustainability or a mixture of both? Are they rather creating alibis for polluters or real change?

And lastly, what would tech-entrepreneurs have to do to proof to you that their sustainability goals are genuine? 

Feel free to discuss those question and any other thoughts on this subject below, I would be very grateful.

If you look at it another way growth and profit mean power and since power is not something intrinsically good or bad it depends how it is used and since I believe the time to act is now if not long overdue a company which does not use its wealth to act against problems, the most pressing being climate change, is in my opinion a 'bad' company. If the company acts against problems for PR reasons or because it's a cause they believe in does not matter to me as long as there are the best possible results.\n\nI do not know how many people share this opinion, but at least it's my perspective on the topic\n\nAs for information about my demographic:\nI am 18, from Austria and have almost graduated high school (to be more precise: I have the entire Mature aside from the VWA) and would deem myself as a person which thinks quite a lot more about philosophical questions (such as this one) than the people around me."", 'First of all, Not every Startup can have ""protect the climate"" as its primary goal and that\'s okay.

Make a useful product\n2. Protect the environment\n3. Turn a profit\n\nAnd it\'s your job as an entrepreneur to convince your customers/the public that your priorities are in that order an no other. Why useful first? Because many youths are critical of consumerism in general. In their view it\'s better to produce and sell nothing than something that doesn\'t actually make lives better. \n\nMy personal opinion: when presenting what you\'re doing, make ""and do it sustainably"" a very big sidenote. \n\nYou can prove this by publishing and maintaining a sustainability report: analyse your entire business\'s environmental impact, from office heating to product delivery. Obviously include a life cycle analysis of your product. Crucially, detail how you mean to improve each aspect of that report. \n\nYour personal conduct is an important indicator as well: what\'s for lunch in your office? How do you dress? Anybody who uses regional airplanes outs themselves as phonies.

I find that the information they provide themselves can be a good starting point but it is, of course, always filtered. Therefore I look out for ratings, labels (for example fair-trade or good on you), articles about a company and who they belong to (for example Nestlé). To seem eco friendly they should thus be approved by independent media and organisations.\n\nI believe we need innovation to battle this crisis as much as we need less consume. We need it because, unfortunately, our system is based on our consume and I doubt we will be able to change it in time, so technology has to fill in.']"

for a long time, I have wondered if and how one could use the power of FFF other then ""just"" protesting. I have come to the conclusion, that making issues and solutions of climate change more accessible and  creating a platform for discussions about new solutions could increase the ammount of people realising that we have a serious issue, but also allow already intersted people to more easily find resources to create arguments.

My idea is to create a Website based on the mediawiki that is used by [wikipedia.org](https://wikipedia.org). The plan is that existing solutions could be collected in a somewhat organized fassion and associated rearch papers could maybe even be published on the website. Everyone intersted could read about what specifically are problems created by climate change and what could be done about it. Others that work in the field, or that already have gathered some information could create new articles or improve existing ones to improve the site as it grows.

I believe that by introducing a tiered moderation system wich does not allow first time posters to change pages without approval, the ammount of trollage should be miniscule, and due to rollback features, easily reversable.

Do you guys know if something like this already exists, or if you think its a good or bad idea.

I've also heard it's not economical so it won't be used at relevant scales.\n\nStill, I believe the argument about waste containment is actually in favor of nuclear energy (if you have to choose between shutting down either nuclear or fossils first, which arguably is the case if both are used simultaneously) since waste containment in fossil fuels is so much worse; pretty much non-existent, catastrophic failure is more immediate, and it will affect larger areas."", 'I can see why this is a problem, and unless we can find a way to properly dispose it, or a way to reduce the half-life to a few years, then it still is an issue. But then again, why not send it to the sun? (*inserts sarcasm here*). Seriously though, we gotta go pretty deep and somehow find a one-way closure to prevent humans, or any advanced civilizations after ours from digging the site. I think another channel, Wendover Productions, did. make a video on the issue of nuclear waste.', 'I can see where you’re coming from. Nuclear is surprisingly clean and ranks just under wind power in terms of emission. People often get scared of the word nuclear as it is mostly associated with warheads and destruction. Nuclear seems to be a high risk-high reward for many. The risk of a disaster to the scale of Chernobyl or Fukushima is enough to deter people.\n\nPlus, nuclear plants don’t produce much short-term profit, sth politicians have to rely as the majority of the population are, for the lack of better terms, short-sighted. We haven’t done much and not for long enough to achieve the full potential of nuclear power.\n\nEven my dad agrees with me, and he has a masters degree in environmental science since 2008, and he often states how good nuclear energy is as he has attended several IAEA meetings. He also teaches environmental science in a university where I live and works in the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) Department in the Ministry. He personally stated that nuclear is powerful, but a big investment, and many aren’t just up for it.', 'good point', 'That’s the thing many people haven’t thought about. Many don’t see CO2 as a waste product, in fact, it is. And we chose to ignore it as it is naturally occurring. In medical terms, the dose makes the poison. Every substance ever known to man will be dangerous at a high level. Thus, the danger is there, we so often dismiss it. Another waste are the oxides and we breathe it in everyday. \n\nIt’s like gradually increasing the temperature, you wouldn’t feel it. Radiation poisoning is more like jumping in hot water, you would feel it immediately.', ""i thought about shooting the waste into space, too. But as we would have to do this really often, two problems occur: at first, rockets have a bad economical impact. second, rockets aren't failsafe and you really don't want uranium waste exploding in the stratosphere."", ""I know other people don't like it. I don't agree with them."", 'Not only are rockets not nearly fail safe, their maximum load is often pretty limited — a modern Falcon Heavy can only lift up to 26.700kg. That would be plenty of nuclear waste, but you can’t just stuff it into the rocket, it needs a casing too. So you waste large quantities of waste with building a nuclear save container around you waste and thus greatly reducing the capacity of each flight.', 'I mean the only way to remove the waste is if we somehow had a dematerializer, or something along the lines of anti-matter. And as far as I’m concerned, it only exists in science fiction. I mean that’s a great idea, but we are limited by the technologies of our time. Still, this may be the reason I want to become a scientist.', 'I think nuclear is a pretty controversial thing. For short-time “clean” energy it is great. It can greatly help the transition to a greener energy industry, but when the nuclear power plants eventually get old, you have to maintain them. If you won’t maintain them, you’ll end up with something like France, which has a growing number of nuclear power plants with cracks in the shielding. \nAnd you obviously always have a risk with the reactor doing things that are not particularly helpful for the environment and thus helping the bad reception of nuclear power plants in the general public. \nAlso you have the obvious problems with storing the old nuclear fuel and much more storing them safely over a span of >1000 years. As world history shows, it is very likely that a war happens in this time period and maybe the enemy doesn’t know about the nuclear fuel storage und whoops — a bomb lands on it. Or with climate change and rise of sea levels just like that the nuclear fuel storage is in the ocean. You have to consider wisely, where your storage can be and you have to talk to the people. Because their concerns are as important as the concerns of peoples which homes are getting removed for coal. Do you want to have a possibly leaky nuclear waste storage next to your home?', 'well it is possible to make antimatter, but it would cost much more money and energy than you could generate from nuclear material', 'Well you can always use thorium, a better material as if the reactor fails, all you have to do is drain it away from plutonium and you’re good.\nAs thorium creates more energy while producing less waste, cheaper and safer to mine and overall more stable than uranium, a new-gen reactor would likely be powered by thorium and plutonium. Also you can’t make a bomb out of thorium without plutonium. You can check the channel Sam’O Nella for thorium.', 'The risks are several magnitudes less than any other power source. And all the concerns about storage are things that nuclear scientists obviously have thought about. Most of the problems with nuclear energy today is because the field and sector has been severely underfunded for many decades due to irrational public fear. All infrastructure requires maintenance, nuclear energy is no different.', 'That’s what I’m saying, I have a crap ton of ways to ‘theoretically’ get rid of the waste (emphasize on theoretically) that has no basis on reality. Well, the best we could do now is to bury it, and we’ll probably have to deal with it within the next half century, but I think it’s worth the wait as this sort of waste issue isn’t caused by consumerism, so it should be theoretically easier to fix with the progress of technology.', ""i don't think its an option to bury it now and hope to find a way to get rid of it later. because if its leaking now, we could damage our water and ecosystem unrepairable. also, what if we don't find a way to get rid of the waste?\ni think we should focus on more reachable options now. like tide and wave power plants or wind energy. there is a lot of energy we could generate there, but somehow aren't."", 'By burying, I meant to bury it safely, making sure that when the time comes, we could easily deal with it without it having issues because we have built it so safely. So we have to somehow account for hundreds of years to come. Renewable energy would be ideal, but to breach the power gap, we need nuclear. We will eventually abandon nuclear, as with any other technology, but if we take global warming and climate change as our top priority, nuclear seems to be the perfect replacement. As our focus shifts from global warming and climate change to nuclear waste, then we could find ways to improve on nuclear waste reduction or somehow find a way to get rid of it. Technology will grow and at one point, space exploration will be more advanced than at our times. At this point, we could reliably send it to the big incinerator (aka the sun) without much consequence. An important thing to note, however is that I don’t think that the environmental problem could end. It may just be a cycle, it’s just on different sectors.']"

What does this mean? It means more server capacity is needed, and if the co2 emissions by servers were incredibly high before, they will be even higher now, and be still on the rise.
This is a problem. But I feel it could be a chance aswell, right now. To draw attention and to actually make a difference.

Fossil fuel powerplants are at risk of shutting down, which is a good thing. Also, as the price of renewable power continues to plummet, we'll most likely (not certainly though) see a world run by green energy in the near future. It all depends on the policy of a country post-Covid. For transportation, it's a bit harder. Ships can be nuclear-powered, and although not as clean, it's far better than oil or diesel. Trains may be the new form of inter-provincial, interstate and even cross country mode of transportation as fast trains and cleaner energy sources mean that using a train is more eco-friendly option. For cars, buses and especially planes, I'm not so sure. Cars and buses can go electric, but at a high price. Planes cannot do that. Unless there is a major leap in technology where a fuel source has a higher energy density that produces less carbon dioxide, or a way to break laws of thermodynamics, I would say it's very hard to curb a plane's emission.

There is no way to justify consumtion of animal products.\n\nHowever, eating animal products does not make you a villain. Every single person, no matter how good you are, commits unmoral actions. Weather it is buying fast fashion, flying or eating meat.\n\nI do think the way we treat animals will be seen as one of humanitys greatest crimes in the future though. And if you want to be on the right side of history, the only reasonablr thing to do is going vegan', 'I’m not vegan, although I do support those who are willing to go vegan. I think veganism is great for the environment. I won’t advocate for abrupt change, however, because millions of animals ,which are no longer profitable, will be released, damaging crops and the ecosystem of their surroundings. What I suggest is a gradual cut down on meat consumption per capita. I’m also convinced that total veganism isn’t great either, as farm animals could roam around, destroying crops and cause a famine. So I would say you can eat meat to a certain extent to maintain a stable ecosystem, but just don’t over do it. \n\nPersonally, I’m trying to curb my meat consumption, and countries with high meat consumption per capita should try and reduce it as well.', '[deleted]', ""I advocate for all actions that contributes to a long-term lowering of the radiative forcing of Earth's atmosphere, in descending order of promoting human well-being. Keep going down that 'list' until we're in accordance with the best available science on how to reach social, economic and ecological sustainability.\n\nI have no special interest in veganism other than how it relates to the aforementioned conceptual list.\n\nI would find it curious if any environmentalist disagreed with me on this."", 'I am not against, as long as it doesnt affect me or you dont lecture me', ""Cool if you want to. Personally I prefer a low meat diet as it's still the easiest way to get some types of nutrients."", 'This is exactly what i think. Thanks for your comment!', ""A vegan world is possible. Of course it has to be gradual, because we wouldn't have a way to take are of the huge amount of farm animals that are bread into existans. But everyone going vegan over night is never going to happen, so that is not a problem."", 'Yes! Absolutely true. But for those companies to change they need motivation, and their motivation is money. So by stop paying these companies i.e. going vegan, they will be foreced to change.', 'It is theoretically possible, given that history has shown us that most peasants in history did not eat much meat. But I think if we have to make it work, then make meat, for the lack of a better phrase,  a sort of guilty pleasure, to secure morale. Also at that point, the population of livestock’s should be sustainable enough for humans to consume it at certain times without impacting the environment.', '[deleted]', ""It's not just about sustainability though, but also about ethics. You cannot in any way justify eating animal products, because the only reason for it is sensory pleasure and the life of a sentient being is worth more than that.\n\nSo even if you just eat meat occationally, you are still committing an unmoral act. (Excuse my bad spelling, english is not my first language)"", 'Even if they have good life, we have no right to end it.', 'True... I know eating meat is both an environmental and an ethical issue (I should have pointed that out) but right now I’m focusing more on the environment. And if anything, eating meat is a natural act for omnivores.', ""> It's not just about sustainability though, but also about ethics. You cannot in any way justify eating animal products\n\nFor some people it is. I don't have a problem with the ethics of consuming meat. I don't think it's immoral to kill animals for food. My personal perspective is purely one of sustainability."", 'I often heat people say eating meat is natural. But if it is natural, why are we getting disgusted by seeing an animal getting killed? A tiger would get hungry.\n\nAlso, why do we have short, soft fingernail and dull canine teeth? We would have an extremely hard time killing an animal with our bare hands. \n\nOur digest system does not like meat either. Humans digestive systems are very long, similar to other plant-eating animals.\n\nLastly, meat causes heart desease in humans. Saturated fats and cholesterol (only found in animal products) contribute to a bunch of deseases.', 'Have you seen dominion by any chance?', 'We are disgusted by seeing animals killed because the human brain evolves to feel empathy as a social animal. This, however, doesn’t mean the majority of us could see the connection between the murder of a life and the meal in front of us.\n\nWe have short fingernails due to human specialization in Intelligence. Why have sharp claws when you can throw a spear or shoot an arrow at an animal. Our teeth has adapted due to the invention of fire, which makes meat softer. This means that we don’t need as much jaw power to chew meat, nor the sharp teeth.\n\nThat’s a good point there on our digestive tract. Many omnivores actually have digestive tract that is a combination of both ends, as omnivores have a good amount of intestine to help digest cellulose, but they don’t have such big cecum as herbivores do. Certain animals such as orangutans eat meat in desperation. Humans have probably learned to like meat due to their fat content which was a way to survive harsh winters back then.\n\nBringing on to health, I agree that excess meat consumption, especially processed meat, is a big risk factor in coronary heart disease and may up your chances in having a stroke. Excess consumption of carbohydrates which is derived from plants, however, is a much bigger threat to human health, causing diabetes and something called a metabolic syndrome. I’m no doctor, but if my understanding is right, then metabolic syndrome is an issue caused by eating excess carbohydrates. This is far worse than over consumption of meat. As insulin resistance build up, so does the chemical to tell the liver to store excess glucose as fat and subsequently saturated. I do want to point out that consumption of vegetables and grains are not part of this, but this is what many people tend to eat instead of meat. Eating a healthy amount of nuts, grains and vegetable should not do much harm if you keep it just right. Just keep things moderate.\n\nOn a personal note: that was a great debate and I’m not ready to put a pen down on this, but I just want to tell you I’m siding with vegans. Although not a vegan, I am curbing my meat consumption and I may just go vegetarian.', ""Most of these arguments are horrible. We get disgusted because our culture over the last 100 or so years has produced media, narratives, and sub-cultures where we are supposed to empathize with animals, which I'm not saying is bad, but it demonstrates that our disgust for seeing animals getting killed is not natural. We have media like Disney's Bambi, Snow White, Donald Duck, Zootopia etc. household pets are more common than ever and there are pet shows and pet sports and what not. Ofcourse a lot of people start humanize animals in such a culture. Meanwhile, if you look at for example cattle farmers, they have no disgust for their animals getting slaughtered, even though many still honestly care deeply for their animals well-being. If you go back in history or even pre-history when we used to hunt, of course people reacted like other hunters do when they saw prey or animals getting killed.\n\n> Also, why do we have short, soft fingernail and dull canine teeth? \n\nBecause we invented cooking and hunting tools. Have you seen the [massive canines of a chimpanzee](https://i.imgur.com/KBK4xzc.png)? And they have a mostly vegetarian diet. We don't have claws because our ancestral species where mostly scavengers, and so they didn't actually need to kill in order to get access to meat.\n\n> Our digest system does not like meat either. Humans digestive systems are very long, similar to other plant-eating animals.\n\nAgain, because we evolved from animals who only ate meat supplementary. It takes a long time for something like a digestive system to evolve into something else, and today's high level of meat consumption has only prolonged for 50-100 years, and you would need millions of years for it to have any substantial effect. However, it is a well known-fact that the main reason that we were able to evolve significantly larger brains than other great apes is because we started eating more meat.\n\nBut none of this is actually relevant to why we should reduce our meat consumption drastically, as the environmental argument alone is plenty enough."", ""Nope, and if it is what I think it is, it's not going to be persuasive."", ""Of course these aren't arguments for going vegan. I just tried to explain that meat eating isn't as natural for humans as most people think. As you yourself said; we have evolved away from that. \n\nThe biggest argument for veganism is that it is simply unethical killing a sentient being that does not want to die."", '> As you yourself said; we have evolved away from that.\n\nThat\'s not at all what I said, I said that we stem from animals who ate meat in supplementary amounts and so it is not at all ""unnatural"" for humans to eat meat.\n\nInfact, I argued that because our differentiation from the other great apes is largely due to our increased consumption of meat, humans are *more* adapted to eating meat than any other great ape.\n\n> The biggest argument for veganism is that it is simply unethical killing a sentient being that does not want to die.\n\nOnly if you think it\'s unethical to kill any sentient being that does not want to die.']"

We have started a growing organization Start With You, which aims to decrease our adverse ecological impact on the environment. This is something that can be pursued from the comfort of your home amidst quarantines all over the world. 


Our functioning will be in a chapter-wise fashion where each chapter founder (wherever in the world they may be) forms a core team locally. The core teams shall calculate the carbon, water, and ecological footprint for their community (by surveying the residents) using our database of user-friendly environmental calculators. After this simple data collection, the core team will analyse and identify the largest environmental problem in their community. Then they will use our resources and collaborate with the organization’s executive board to plan and implement community-based strategies to address this problem and measure impact.

 You are welcome to initiate and lead a chapter in your region, form a core team locally, and get going! We're going to be supporting you in the process.


If not interested in chapters, you can join one or more of the following teams that are being formed-

1. Bloggers on anything related to environmental sustainability, ranging anywhere from lifestyle tips to analytical articles. 

2. Social media experts and outreach managers who would be integral to showcasing the mission and accomplishments. 

3. Artists, musicians, singers, poets, dancers, anyone with a creative streak who would like to express and promote the cause of environmental sustainability through art forms! 


You can sign up here-

Back to the Future! Italian open letter with 7 requests,all4Nature,21,g6j039,FridaysForFuture,https://ritornoalfuturo.org/la-lettera/,1,,1587630653.0,21,0,,"[""Translation:   \n\n\nDear Italy,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nListen to this silence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur normality was turned upside down and we woke up in a nightmare. We find ourselves locked in our homes, isolated and anguished, waiting for the end of this pandemic. We don't know when we can return to our lives, to our loved ones, to the classroom or to work. Worse, we do not know if there will still be a job waiting for us, if companies will be able to get up, crushed by the worst economic crisis since the war.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps we could have avoided this disaster?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany studies claim that this crisis is linked to the ecological emergency. The continuous destruction of natural spaces forces many wild animals, carriers of diseases dangerous to humans, to live in close contact with us. We know with certainty that this will only be the first of many other crises - health, economic or humanitarian - due to climate change and its poisoned fruits. More and more torrid summers and warmer winters, floods and droughts have already been destroying our crops for years, causing incalculable damage and increasing numbers of victims. The relentless rise in temperatures will bring us infectious diseases that are typical of warmer climates or still completely unknown, risking us plunging into a new epidemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre we destined for this? What if we have a way out instead? An idea that can solve both the climate crisis and the economic crisis? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear Italy, this is why we are writing to you: the solution already exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe exit from the health crisis will have to be the moment to start again, and the ecological transition will be the heart and the brain of this rebirth: the starting point for a revolution of our entire system. The challenge is ambitious, we know, but the stakes are too high to back down. We must start a colossal, historic, sustainable public investment plan that will bring prosperity and jobs for all and everyone and that will finally give us a Future to return to, after the journey into the darkness of this pandemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA future in which we will produce all our energy from renewable sources and no longer need to buy oil, coal and methane from abroad. In which, by stopping burning fossil fuels, reconverting polluting companies and reclaiming our devastated territories, we will be able to save the more than 80,000 people killed each year by air pollution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine, dear Italy, your cities will be green and free from traffic. Not because we will still be forced into our homes, but because we will move thanks to an efficient public transport that is accessible to everyone and everyone. With a great national plan we will renovate public and private buildings, reducing emissions and bills. We will restore dignity to your endless beauty, your parks and your mountains. We will be able to rely on the air, water, and essential goods that your natural ecosystems, healthy and intact, give us. We will produce the food for which we are famous throughout the world in a sustainable way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this way we will create hundreds of thousands of new, well-paid jobs in all sectors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis Future is really possible, dear Italy, we are convinced of it. To face this health emergency we are finally listening to science. And it is precisely science that clearly shows us the path to take in order to defeat the climate crisis. This time we know how much time we have left to act: we have already entered the crucial decade. The moment of the collapse of the only ecosystem in which we can live, the overcoming of 1.5°C of global warming, is already on the horizon. The crazy emissions curve must be reversed this year, and forever. Only if we succeed in doing so will we build a fairer, more equitable country and world for all and everyone, not at the expense of the weakest, but of those few who have built their profits on the climate crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear Italy, you are at a crossroads in your history, and there must be no short-sighted budgetary constraints or unfair austerity policies that prevent you from achieving this turning point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear Italy, you can set an example. You can lead Europe and the world on the road to ecological conversion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot every generation is given the chance to really change history and create a better world - the only one in which life is possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is our last chance. We cannot afford to go back to the past. We must look forward and prepare for our Return to the Future!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: This is just the beginning. Today begins a great campaign for the rebirth of our country, which will take us to the launch of a series of concrete proposals at global #DigitalStrike on April 24th.

"Poem: Our children, the environment, and the coronavirus pandemic",baby_BOOMER_51,5,g0ug4s,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/g0ug4s/poem_our_children_the_environment_and_the/,0,"**It’s supposed to work the other way round**

This moment in history may not be allowed   
To one day be reduced to that horrible memory   
Of the time when a misanthropic virus   
Obliterated our oldest generations.   
This is also the moment when our children,   
Selflessly do their part and make their sacrifice.   
One of education,   
Of companionship,   
Of social development,   
And of personal freedom.   
All to slow the virus’s maniacal spread   
And to keep hospitals operating below full capacity.

For the well-being of their elders,   
They form new routines,   
Grow accustomed to isolation and seclusion,   
And do so with consideration and compassion,   
And do so without protest.

And once the global quarantine is over,   
Will this ongoing sacrifice be forgotten?   
Or downplayed?   
Or dismissed?

Will airlines once again be allowed to carve highways in the stratosphere,   
Heating the planet with their emissions and jet streams?   
Will economies once again be allowed to pursue their insatiable thirst for growth,   
Heedless of the Earth that can no longer sustain it,   
And numb to our children’s love?

For you see,   
Even before this crisis,   
The children had been going to school   
And living their lives as inhabitants of this planet

Without a nice story.

── And we were numb to them then.

With little to look forward to   
And even more to dread.

But we now know what we can accomplish.   
When we really want to.   
When we really try.   
Now we know that we can shut down emissions when we want to.   
We can divest from fossil fuels.   
We can stop the drilling.  
We can halt the runaway deforestation.   
We can raise wind turbines and solar farms   
With the ambition of the societies that covered the world with road and rails   
One hundred years ago.   
We can train workers for the   
Stimulating,   
Formative,   
And even till now restrained   
Green, Social, and Artistic Industries.

If we reduce the memory of this pandemic to its horror and its pain  
And allow the ongoing sacrifice of our grandchildren to be forgotten,   
Downplayed,   
Or dismissed,   
And if we go on living with a sense of entitlement,   
Halting the progress that endangers the fulfilment of our every frivolous whim,   
Of our every appetite and pleasure,   
Our grandchildren will inherit a world in a permanent state of crisis and shortage.   
Droughts.   
Forest fires.   
Rising sea levels.   
Ocean acidification.   
Mass extinction.   
To name a few.   
There, in that world,   
The sacrifices and abstinence of this unfolding pandemic   
Would tragically pale in comparison.   
For today the supermarkets are full   
And we are still revitalized and inspired by the green.

If we can park the children,   
To save our skin,   
We must finally park our comfort and paralysis in their name,   
Decidedly and for good.

It’s the parents who are supposed to take care of their children.   
But the children are the ones currently making the concessions.   
They are the ones putting us first,   
Although it should be the other way round.

But it does not have to be this way.   
We have to finally acknowledge our responsibility   
To our children   
And take the measures necessary   
To perform that long overdue act of love.",1586821336.0,5,0,,[]

EPA employees are largely working remotely and continue to do their jobs. \n\nThis kind of misinformation spreading hurts us all. Get your facts right. And if you are in the press, read the fricking press releases from the agency before coming out with bullshit headlines.', 'Um, yes and no... this is a pretty-good article describing the situation:\n\nhttps://insideclimatenews.org/news/27032020/coronavirus-covid-19-EPA-API-environmental-enforcement', ""EPA Corrects the Record after Reckless Reporting on Temporary Compliance Guidance\n\nEnvironmental News\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nWASHINGTON (March 30, 2020) — The mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to protect human health and the environment, and during this time of unprecedented public health concerns, that mission is even more critical. On March 26, EPA released a temporary policy regarding the agency's enforcement of environmental legal obligations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This temporary policy is not a license to pollute.\n\nWe strongly encourage the press to actually read EPA’s Temporary Policy before repeating reckless propaganda about it. Instead of including factual information about the policy, outlets such as E&E News, The Hill, the AP, and the New York Times are relying on sources who falsely claim that the policy provides a blanket waiver of environmental requirements or creates a presumption that the pandemic is the cause of noncompliance.\n\nHere are some of the facts that have been conveniently left out of the press narrative:\n\nThe policy says that EPA will not seek penalties for noncompliance with routine monitoring and reporting requirements, if, on a case-by-case basis, EPA agrees that such noncompliance was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulated parties must document the basis for any claim that the pandemic prevented them from conducting that routine monitoring and reporting and present it to EPA upon request. This action was necessary to avoid tying up EPA staff time with questions about routine monitoring and reporting requirements and instead allow EPA to focus on continued protection of human health and the environment. \n\nThe policy does not say that the COVID-19 pandemic will excuse exceedances of pollutant limitations in permits, regulations, and statutes. EPA expects regulated entities to comply with all obligations and if they do not, the policy says that EPA will consider the pandemic, on a case-by-case basis, when determining an appropriate response. Further, in cases that may involve acute risks or imminent threats, or failure of pollution control or other equipment that may result in exceedances, EPA’s willingness to provide even that consideration is conditioned on the facility contacting the appropriate EPA region, or authorized state or tribe, to allow regulators to work with that facility to mitigate or eliminate such risks or threats. \n\nEPA has been inundated with questions from both state regulators and the regulated community about how to handle the current extraordinary situation where contractors are not available because they cannot travel, state and local governments are imposing stay at home orders, and the number of people who have contracted COVID-19 and are in quarantine is rising. EPA developed the Temporary Policy to allow EPA to prioritize its resources to respond to acute risks and imminent threats, rather than making up front case-by-case determinations regarding routine monitoring and reporting. The development of the policy was a group effort, involving multiple calls and with and drafts shared among EPA staff and managers, both career and political, at both headquarters and in the regions.\n\nIt is important to note EPA expects regulated facilities to comply with regulatory requirements, where reasonably practicable, and to return to compliance as quickly as possible, once the COVID-19 threat is over.

We can all agree and unify behind the benefit of humans living sustainably on a fertile and healthy planet.\n\nTo get there, we must fight against the disconnection from nature which the past 200 years has created.

My name is Chris and I’m a 16 year old in St. Louis, MO. Last year, a few friends and I created a youth-run nonprofit organization called [Clean My Planet](https://cleanmyplanet.xyz/). We intend to launch widespread initiatives and online campaigns that will allow younger people to get more involved with the environment. 

Because our vision is global in nature, we need people around the US and globally to help us with our early-stage growth. We're looking for people of various talents/skills (videomaking, graphic design, networking etc.) to establish a branch in their area, or if you don't have that much time on your hands, you can work remotely. Leadership positions are available but with the prereq of time commitment and dedication.

So far we have a few dozen members across different countries. We've conducted different projects like river cleanups, educational events, and our Portugal and India branches are currently collaborating on an air-quality monitoring device to be installed in the homes of New Delhi. We have lots of other ideas as well.

We have maybe ten years, 10 YEARS! Before we reach the 1.5 C° mark and if reach that, we have perhaps a 50% chance that our planet won't have uncontrollable disasters. Don't let the first domino fall, because if the first one falls, the rest will fall too. For me, this is ridiculous because we know about that since 1990, maybe even 1980 and we still didn't make the important decision that we need to save our planet. Our planet is not something where we can restart and try again. NO! We are right here, right now, in this dangerous situation, that might doesn't seem dangerous for you, but it is. This isn't a situation anymore where just the politic has to change, no, this is a situation where everyone has to change, and that means if you say that isn't important for you, you're are gambling with your future. Those easy solutions you might hear about, like e-cars or planting trees, aren't enough anymore to save our planet. Our planet needs more than just simple solutions. We need a change in every person's life and politics. So don't just say it's important, because words won't help the planet. Do something against climate change and the people that say it's a lie. There're enough things you can do, like saving energy or buying less plastic, going on the streets and demonstrate against our unfair climate politics or just planting trees. You alone won't make a big difference, but if everyone does something, we can save our planet before it's too late.",1572389160.0,8,0,,[]

📢Il report dell’IPCC (Gruppo Intergovernativo sui Cambiamenti Climatici) dello scorso agosto ha riconosciuto il ruolo dei Popoli Indigeni come guardiani delle foreste, confermando l’importanza del loro contributo alla lotta contro i cambiamenti climatici.

Dal 17 ottobre al 20 novembre, una delegazione di leader indigeni visiterà 12 Paesi europei, tra cui l’Italia, per presentare la Campagna ""Sangue indigeno: non una goccia in più"", promossa dall'associazione APIB - Articulação dos Povos Indígenas do Brasil in collaborazione con numerose organizzazioni della società civile. ( Parents for Future Torino Casacomune Missionari della Consolata CISV )

La campagna mira a:
🔥denunciare le sistematiche violazioni ai diritti delle popolazioni indigene del Brasile, intensificate dall’entrata in carica del Presidente Jair Bolsonaro;

🔥fare pressione sul governo brasiliano e sulle aziende del settore agroalimentare affinché rispettino gli accordi internazionali sui cambiamenti climatici e sui diritti umani sottoscritti dallo stesso Brasile (Accordo di Parigi, Convenzione 169 dell’Organizzazione Internazionale del Lavoro - OIL, Dichiarazione delle Nazioni Unite sui diritti dei Popoli Indigeni e la Dichiarazione di New York sulle foreste).

🔥informare sugli impatti nascosti dietro a prodotti brasiliani provenienti da aree di conflitto o da terre indigene.

Il viaggio inizierà proprio in Italia, a Roma, in Vaticano, con la presenza dei leader indigeni al Sinodo sull’Amazzonia, inaugurato venerdì scorso da Papa Francesco, che in tale occasione ha chiesto di rispettare le culture indigene. Dopo Città del Vaticano e Roma, la delegazione visiterà anche Torino e Bologna, per poi proseguire con le diverse tappe europee.

But I also don't want my parents to get a call that I'm not in school and flip their lids at me. My closest government building is like, 4 blocks away if you count weird turns? And I've done hours of googling and my strike would be perfectly legal, even if I started playing music or chanting. And I'm totally certain that I will be the only one going for a long time, maybe one of my closer friends whose parents are cool. But how did yall's parents react? What did y'all say to calm their worries? And what advice do yall have for me?",1569856019.0,34,0,,"[""I think a very important thing, regardless really of the strikes, is to be properly informed and understand the situation. Greta actually read the IPCC sr15 and did all the hard legwork to understand what it states and how to interpret the data. She has done *a lot* of studying on climatology just in general, to a point where she is far more well-informed than the average citizen, even if she doesn't dabble with actual climatologists. Now that would be step 1 for you.\n\nIf you're already there, then you can probably motivate your actions rationally and in an emotionally sensible way to your parents. I'm not saying that it's easy, but if you fear your parents reaction's more than the current and future state of the climate system, then you probably need to read up some more. And when you've done that, you might realize that for you, with your mind and your skills, striking isn't the path you should take. Or you'll get re-affirmed that it is.\n\nAnd I'm also horribly sorry that you and people in your age are put in this completely fucked up position.

I just had to explain the gravity of the situation,how every single person was playing a major role in this movement and why my involvement was important. I assured them I’ll try my best to not let my studies suffer. I’m fortunate to have parents who understand the urgency to act in this situation and they are trying too.\nAnd what Dave37 said above is eminently accurate \nWe need to approach this step by step \nFirst we should inform ourselves of the data available till now so that we understand what the situation is in reality and make others informed too\nAnd start doing something about it right here and right now \nBecause along with setting aside Fridays for future, we have to compensate for many exploitative years our earth have faced \nAnd the only way it can be done is by changing our teensiest derelict ways of living along with the big ones we are demanding in the strikes. \nSo even if there are Fridays you can’t make it, you can do plenty by doing things \nBy talking to people whom you meet and convincing them to go plastic free as far as they can, waste less water, take proper waste disposal seriously, not using vehicles for short distances, cutting the use of tissue papers, and much more.!\nAnd don’t forget to blast every writer’s society with your poems.

[www.ipcc.ch/report/srocc](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srocc/)

On 20–23 September 2019 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will 
meet in Monaco to consider the Intergovernmental Panel and Climate Change (IPCC) 
Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) for approval. 
Subject to approval, SROCC will be launched on 25 September 2019 with a live-streamed 
press conference at 11am CEST at the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. 
For this Special Report, more than 100 scientists from more than 30 countries assessed the 
latest scientific knowledge about the physical science basis and impacts of climate change 
on ocean, coastal, polar and mountain ecosystems, and the human communities that 
depend on them. Their vulnerabilities as well as adaptation capacities were also evaluated. 
Options for achieving climate-resilient development pathways were presented as well. 
SROCC follows the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) released in August 
2019 and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C released in October 2018.

An open letter to the Boomer Generation,QubixVarga,73,d834ex,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/d834ex/an_open_letter_to_the_boomer_generation/,9," Dear Boomers,

You state time and time again that your children are the most precious things you have. You time and time again say that the only thing you care about is the future of you children. However, your actions and inactions shows that the opposite is true. You couldn’t care less. Your unwillingness to change your behaviours for the sake of your children and their future show that these are only empty words, or straight up lies. 

It is the young people who vote for politicians with a green agenda. 

It is the young people who gives up consumption and polluting habits for the greater good. 

It is the children and young people who give up education - the most important thing they have - to go on strikes and hold companies and politicians accountable.  

This is okay. It is understandable. The human species is in nature a selfish one. 

So let’s strike a deal, shall we? You don’t care about our future, and we won’t care about your future. 

Done.

If I were you though, I would seriously rethink this deal.

First, all countries in the western world experience a rapid shift in our age structure. Every single year the number of tax payers decreases and the number of elderly increases. This means that in the future, less of us are going to pay for more of you. You do not want us not caring about your future. 

Also, the myth that the effects of the climate crisis will only be felt by the younger generation sometime in the distant future has to finally be debunked. Just pause for a minute and look around and you will see that the effects of climate change can be seen now, here and everywhere. And make no mistake about it, it will only get worse from here on out. Natural disasters are going to get stronger and more frequent. starvations are going to be everyday life for a vast number of people around the world. This, in turn, will lead to mass immigration and conflicts of unseen proportions. Sure, we are going to live with these changes for a longer period of time, and they are going to be a bigger part of our lives. But please be aware that it will indeed affect your lives as well. 

So let’s reconsider this deal we made. Let’s care about each other’s futures, like we should. 

You’re in lucky. Because right now it happens to climate action week. Young people in almost all countries on all continents are protesting. Please listen to our demands. They are not unreasonable. We just want a liveable future. 

Now is the time for you to show that you’re not only saying empty words. Now is the time to show that you actually do care about the future of your children. And if you do - if only for a little bit of what you’re saying - then join us in this fight. Come demand a better future. And if not for your children, then at least do it for your own sake.

1. Large strikes and protests erupt across the country. The protesters floods the streets and city squares, disrupting traffic and central commerce. 
2. The authorities ask the protesters to return to work and normal work. 
3. Protesters persist. 
4. Authorities escalate in several steps with arrests, violence, tear gas, riot police etc.
5. Protesters persist. They figure out how to handle distribution of food, shelter, warm clothes and sanitation on location.
6. Authorities start to use deadly violence.
7. Protesters persist.
8. Civil war breaks out.
9. Protesters and militant resistance forces persist, government gets toppled.
10. Planet persists (unless power vacuum and authoritarian factions grab power)

Signs of Collapse 2019 Q2,Dave37,33,c803kk,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/c803kk/signs_of_collapse_2019_q2/,3,"Hi /r/FridaysForFuture! I have been working on an ongoing project for three and a half year now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). We can all see how the natural world that we’re depending on is degrading at an increased pace while the warnings of the scientific community is ignored. I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable and free from fossil fuels, it's imperative that everyone fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

Urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. I hope this collection of catastrophes can serve as sharp ammunition in whatever project or demonstration you participate in.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.

The report comes just days after Carnival agreed to pay a $20m fine and undertake increased monitoring after it was found to still be dumping sewage and plastic waste, leaking gas and dirty water and falsifying records of incidents.', ""right.

Juni 2019 mogojon 0 Kommentare\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#FridaysforFuture ist ein Aufruf zu einem friedlichen Streik am Freitag, der von Greta Thunberg zum Schutz der Umwelt gestartet wurde.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWir mögen denken, dass dieser Aufruf ein idealistischer Ansatz ist, weit entfernt von der Realität, der uns in unserem täglichen Leben nicht betrifft. Aber das ist nicht der Fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDer Umweltnotstand, in dem wir uns befinden, ist nicht das Ergebnis dessen, was die Medien ""menschliche Aktivität"" nennen, als wäre es eine logische Folge des Lebens. Wenn nicht sogar hauptsächlich von dem wirtschaftlichen und produktiven Modell, in dem wir leben.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEin Modell, das auf dem demographischen Wachstum, dem Konsum von Waren und Dienstleistungen und der territorialen Expansion basiert. Dieses Modell, das in seiner zeitlichen Projektion zum Zusammenbruch führt, braucht den Konsum von Territorium, um zu funktionieren. Das Gebiet ist hauptsächlich mit der Materialgewinnung und der demographischen Entwicklung verbunden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDas Territorium ist die Umgebung, in der sich die Bevölkerung entwickelt. Seine Degradierung betrifft uns alle als Kollektiv und verletzt unsere Rechte, die elementarsten von ihnen, die der Selbsterhaltung selbst.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDie Erhaltung des Territoriums wird dann zu einem Urrecht, das noch wichtiger ist als andere Rechte, wie das Recht auf Eigentum oder sogar das Recht auf Arbeit. Kurz gesagt, es ist ein gemeinsames Bedürfnis.\n\nAus dieser Perspektive hört der von #FridaysforFuture vorgeschlagene Kampf auf, ein utopischer Kampf zu sein und wird zu einem echten Kampf. Diese Schlacht wird heute an verschiedenen Orten in UNSEREM Gebiet ausgetragen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDas Projekt, das das Unternehmen INTU nach diesem veralteten und räuberischen Modell an der natürlichen Stelle von LES MOLES umsetzen will, ist ein klares Beispiel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnter dem falschen Versprechen, Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen, versuchen sie, ein Projekt zu starten, das ein Raubtier des Territoriums ist, innerhalb eines Wirtschaftsmodells, das sich als veraltet erweist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDieses Projekt, das keinen anderen Zweck als die Bodenspekulation durch einen englischen multinationalen Konzern wie andere hat, wird von den lokalen Behörden normalerweise sehr positiv aufgenommen. Mehr darum, ihr Image an ihre Wähler verkaufen zu können, als darum, das Leben ihrer Mitbürger langfristig zu verbessern. \n\nMit einer besorgniserregenden kurzfristigen Mentalität ziehen sie es vor, sich fotografieren zu lassen, indem sie das Einkaufszentrum einweihen, anstatt tragfähige Modelle des Wirtschaftswachstums zu fördern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nÜbersetzt mit [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator)', 'Anti-Semitic much?', 'Unsure, what the author want to say...', 'The autor try to make them look like birds of prey.']"

More so than insect cultivation (I’ll expound on the comparison between the two in a moment). The whole soy bean industry is rotten. I’d recommend doing some googling on their little “crusade” against fats. \n\nThe reason why soybean cultivation sucks anywhere: \n\n“Industrial soybean agriculture needs vast amounts of acid neutralizing lime as well as synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, all which are creating an environmental hazard” interestingly enough, this applies to nearly all beans. \n\n“The environmental causes by soybean farming isn’t limited to the Amazon; it occurs throughout the world wherever soybeans are produced.” \n\nSo yeah this is everywhere. But regardless the Amazon is obviously important to the whole world so I don’t see your point there. \n\nhttps://www.smallfootprintfamily.com/why-soy-is-bad-for-you-and-the-planet\n\nSummary:\n\nSoybeans need environmentally destroying agriculture techniques to function at any meaningful, commercial scale in anywhere in the world. Your completely right about how the meat industry enables a lot of it. But by removing meat you need to replace it with a protein substitute. Obviously I’ve just explained how damaging commercial bean cultivation is.

Soy is in all of our food. It explains the phenomenon of why girls are hitting puberty earlier and earlier than the previous generations. It used to be blamed on milk. It’s bad for developing babies of any gender. \n\nAll these are paraphrased from the above source but any search will show you the same results and studies that they were based from.

It’s in the context of animal feed but that doesn’t matter when your looking at the nutrition and environmental impacts. You don’t bother to follow up on the listed studies yet you ask me for them.

We could eat whatever plant you like, directly. \nThe two way trough the animals is massively inefficient (beef is at some point a 97% caloric loss). \n\nSo no more soy, let’s plant whatever you wish and eat it directly. \n\nWith the insects we again have to feed valuable crops/whatever insect eat, so we can later eat the insects (the caloric loss may not be as high as chicken, but it will always be a loss compared to consuming plants and their nutrients directly)', 'Let’s forget the soy.

As a bonus we can feed them with many very efficient sustainable crops (unlike the bean). \n\nWhy my obsession with soy (or any beans in general)? Because it’s really harmful to our health and the environment. It’s still being fed to developing babies as formula for god’s sake. The danger isn’t even recognized despite the proof. Not even close to a “clean” and healthy protein source.', 'I don’t see how bug sentience plays into this. We can literally recreate their brains on a computer. Are you going to treat a computer program humanely? Modern computers are well above plants in terms of sentience. What is sentience when were talking about basic organisms? It’s stimulus and reactions. Inputs and outputs. You could very well say the same applies to computers and even humans.', 'I really don’t get your obsession with soy. \nBut you don’t like soy, ok, pick another of the thousands of plants we can eat. \n\nFor example I hate the taste of soy milk, so I drink oat milk.', 'I agree with you that insects would solve our problem almost completely. \nJust being picky here ok? \nIt’s never going to be 1:1 since insects organisms still have to function of something. So only plants are just a true 1:1', 'As I said in the other comment, insects are above plants and feed to food ration can’t be 1:1 since insects organisms have to take energy out of somewhere. \n\nI agree, insects are almost perfect, no debate, but why not just straight plants (no soy for you ;). That is my whole point', 'Yeah I said “almost” 1:1. I think you’re not reading it very well and that’s why you’re so confused. With the eradication of meat there would be more than enough space to facilitate feed crops. \n\nWhy not straight plants? Because, like I said many times, plant based protein substitutes are very weak and often times dangerous. Babies shouldn’t be fed hormone inducing bean juice and ignorant vegetarians shouldn’t insist on plant based diets feeding the world. I’d encourage you to find sources to disprove how fucked up soy is or how much it destroys the environment. \n\nAgain, it’s all about culture. You can’t prevent any meaningful change without changing your basic culture biases and habits.']"

But if you want to create CO2 with C and O2 , it\'s an exothermic chemical reaction which means that it converts more energy than it needs, for example: If you burn wood, you start the fire with some heat and because of that heat the conditions are given to produce CO2 and the chemical reaction will start. In that case, it\'s the fire. If you want to make Oxygen from CO2, you have to make it cold so that the Co2 can react into oxygen and carbon. ', ""Negative emissions isn't by far a silver bullet. There is no single silver bullet to climate change, we have to do all of the things. Cut emissions, eat less meat, plant more trees, and capture carbon out of the atmosphere. We can see already that passing +1C is not a very nice place to be, and so simple *stabilizing* the climate isn't enough, as we don't know yet how bad even +1C will be once the climate does stabilize, only that is will be worse than what we have today. We have to continue to ramp up effort until we get back down to 270ppm CO2 in the atmosphere."", 'Sure, but carbon capture technologies seldom relies on simply converting CO2 to C + O2.

Signs of Collapse 2019 Q1,Dave37,25,b8xmfa,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/b8xmfa/signs_of_collapse_2019_q1/,5,"Hi /r/FridaysForFuture! I have been working on an ongoing project for just over three years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). We can all see how the natural world that we’re depending on is degrading at an increased pace while the warnings of the scientific community are ignored. I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable and free from fossil fuels, it's imperative that everyone fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

Urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. I hope this collection of catastrophes can serve as sharp ammunition in whatever project or demonstration you participate in.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.

Because of this, in addition to protest I've done the following over the path month:

* call and write my congressional representative
* call and write my senators
* call my state-level representative
* write my city council

Aside from pressuring the government to take action on climate change, you're touching on an act that could truly make a difference in human CO2 output:

A four-day work week, where all non-essential businesses are closed, full stop, lights out.

This is one day a week less: Traffic jams and commuting; electricity for lights, computers, copiers, machines, etc, etc, etc for everything from skyscrapers to landscaping companies; shopping for nonessential goods that have to be sourced, manufactured, shipped, and marketed; business and leisure flights seeding pollutants directly into the upper atmosphere-- I'm sure I'm missing a dozen or more benefits.

You get the idea.

If you added into this mix television and community programming for conservation and living a post-carbon lifestyle (for all these people with a new day with nothing to do on their hands), you'd up the awareness and behavioral shift even more.

Reality TV shows about people who live ZeroWaste or ZeroCO2 or who are trying to make the switch. Community centers running seminars and maker classes.

Etc.

One day a week.

That's not so much to ask. And if all businesses do it, it levels the playing field, so no one is profiting because the competitors stay open. Initially if anyone did stay open, they'd make themselves an easy target for boycotting.

Anyway, I know this is beyond the scope of what you're currently trying to achieve, but I wanted to salute your thinking and commitment and put a ""next step"" on your radar.

Look again at that dot.,StargazerDC,8,b1jvrd,FridaysForFuture,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridaysForFuture/comments/b1jvrd/look_again_at_that_dot/,0,"No better way to celebrate this day remembering one of the first persons who talked about climate change and its effects on our environment back in the days: Carl Sagan.   
Too bad the previous generations didn't listen.  


&#x200B;

[ This excerpt from Sagan's book Pale Blue Dot was inspired by an  image taken, at Sagan's suggestion, by Voyager 1 on February 14, 1990.  As the spacecraft left our planetary neighborhood for the fringes of the  solar system, engineers turned it around for one last look at its home  planet. Voyager 1 was about 6.4 billion kilometers \(4 billion miles\)  away, and approximately 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane, when it  captured this portrait of our world. Caught in the center of scattered  light rays \(a result of taking the picture so close to the Sun\), Earth  appears as a tiny point of light, a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. \(source: planetary.org\)](https://preview.redd.it/p027r1cfecm21.jpg?width=453&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fa2bf027d36f5a6e9c00e225a178844dd67b3fb)

 

>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it  everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every  human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our  joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and  economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,  every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,  every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child,  inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt  politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and  sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust  suspended in a sunbeam.  
>  
>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the  rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in  glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction  of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of  one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of  some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they  are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.  
>  
>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we  have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this  point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great  enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is  no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.  
>  
>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is  nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could  migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the  Earth is where we make our stand.  
>  
>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building  experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of  human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it  underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and  to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever  known.  
>  
>\-- Carl Sagan, *Pale Blue Dot*, 1994
